[This ``longer explanation'' was provided by Mark Brader.]
<br>
<br>
In early C,
[casts on <TT>malloc</TT>'s return value]
were not used.  <TT>malloc()</TT> returned a <TT>char&nbsp;*</TT>
value and this could be implicitly converted, as part of the <TT>=</TT>
operator, to the desired pointer type.  (In fact, in very early
C, there was no cast operator and all conversions were implicit.)
<br>
<br>
Later on, implicit conversions of pointer types were seen as
a bad thing, and the language was changed so that an <TT>=</TT> operator
involving pointers needed the same type on both sides.  Thus all
pointer conversions now required an explicit cast.  (In some
compilers, the old-style implicit conversions still worked, but
a warning would occur.)
<br>
<br>
Still later, with the coming of ANSI C, the type <TT>void&nbsp;*</TT> was
introduced, <TT>malloc()</TT> was changed to return that type, and
implicit pointer conversions went back into the language when
<TT>void&nbsp;*</TT> was involved.
<br>
<br>
Therefore, the seemingly redundant casts are used by people who are
<UL><li>(a)
concerned with portability to all pre-ANSI compilers, or
<li>(b)
of the opinion that implicit conversions are a bad thing.

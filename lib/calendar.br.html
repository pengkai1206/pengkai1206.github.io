I suggest the following code for solving both the problem of
computing the day difference between two dates, and the problem
of determining day of week on a given date :
<p>
<pre>
#define DayOfWeek(d,m,y) (int)(DaysElapsed(d,m,y) % 7)

long DaysElapsed(int d,int m,int y) {
    static int cd[]={0,31,59,90,120,151,181,212,243,273,304,334};
    long n=365L*(y-1);

    if (m&lt;3) y--;
    return n+y/4-y/100+y/400+cd[m-1]+d;
}
</pre>
<p>
DayOfWeek macro works exactly the same as the code posted by
Tomohiko Sakamoto, while the day difference between date1 and date2
(date1&lt;=date2) can simply be computed this way:
<p>
<pre>
difference=DaysElapsed(d2,m2,y2)-DaysElapsed(d1,m1,y1);
</pre>
<p>
I think this is by far superior to using mktime(). The code is
100 % portable (even across languages other than C), much faster,
smaller and simpler than mktime(), and does not suffer from year
range limitation.

What is the ``ANSI C Standard?''
</p><p><hr>
<p>
<font face=Helvetica size=8 color=blue><b>A:</b></font>
In 1983,
the American National Standards Institute
(ANSI)
commissioned a
committee, X3J11,
to standardize the C language.
After a long, arduous

process,
including several widespread public reviews,
the committee's
work
was
finally
ratified as
ANS
X3.159-1989
on December 14, 1989,
and published
in the spring of 1990.
For the most part, ANSI C standardized existing practice,
with a few additions from C++
(most notably
function prototypes) and
support for multinational character sets (including the
controversial
trigraph sequences).
The ANSI C standard also formalized the C run-time library
support routines.

</p><p>A year or so later,
the Standard was
adopted as
an international standard,
ISO/IEC&nbsp;9899:1990,
and this ISO Standard replaced the earlier X3.159
even within the United States
(where it was known as




ANSI/ISO 9899-1990 [1992]).
As an ISO Standard,
it is
subject to ongoing revision
through the release of Technical Corrigenda and Normative Addenda.
</p><p>


In 1994,
Technical Corrigendum 1
(TC1)
amended the Standard
in about 40 places,
most of them minor corrections or clarifications,
and
Normative Addendum 1
(NA1)
added about 50 pages of new material,
mostly specifying new library functions for internationalization.
In 1995, TC2 added a few more minor corrections.
</p><p>Most recently,
a major revision of the Standard,
``C99'',
has been completed and adopted.
</p><p>Several versions of the Standard,
including C99 and
the original ANSI Standard,
have
included a ``Rationale,''

explaining many of its decisions,

and discussing

a number of subtle points,
including several of those covered here.

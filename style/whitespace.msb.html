[Someone asked about whitespace in declarations,
e.g. <TT>double&nbsp;*p</TT> versus <TT>double*&nbsp;p</TT>.
Mark Brader sent this email reply to the original poster,
but also copied me, and gave me permission to include the reply here.]

There is no difference; it's a choice of style.  White space next to
a punctuation mark is significant in C in only four cases:
<ol>
<li><p>
inside a string literal, as in <TT>" this "</TT>
<li><p>
inside a character constant, as in <TT>' '</TT>
<li><p>
when it serves to keep two characters from making a
combination that would have another meaning, as in
<pre>
	x = y / *p;
</pre>
where you don't want to form the <TT>/*</TT> comment sign; and
<li><p>
after the macro name in the definition of an object-like
macro (one without an argument list) where the macro
body starts with a <TT>(</TT> character (and therefore looks
like the argument list of a function-like macro), as in
<pre>
	#define X (z)
</pre>
which defines <TT>X</TT> to expand to <TT>(z)</TT>, whereas if the space
after <TT>X</TT> had been omitted it would define <TT>X</TT> with one
argument and expanding to nothing.
</ol>
<p>
With the above exception, you are free to use whitespace next to all
punctuation marks, or not use it, whichever makes the program more
understandable to the reader.
<p>
Some people choose to write
<p>
<pre>
	double* p;
</pre>
<p>
because they think it's clearer that this declares <TT>p</TT> as a <TT>double&nbsp;*</TT>.
However,
<p>
<pre>
	double* p, q;
</pre>
<p>
declares <TT>p</TT> as <TT>double *</TT> and <TT>q</TT> as <TT>double</TT>, <em>not</em> <TT>double&nbsp;*</TT>.  So that style
is very misleading in this case.  The alternative
<p>
<pre>
	double *p, q;
</pre>
<p>
is clearer for this declaration, and most people then use it on the
first one
<p>
<pre>
	double *p;
</pre>
<p>
because consistency also contributes to clarity.
<p>
Not posted because I imagine someone else will say the same thing.
Feel free to post this if you think it would make a useful contribution.

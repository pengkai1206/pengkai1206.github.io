<p>
<font face=Helvetica size=8 color=blue><b>Q:</b></font>
Why
isn't any of this
standardized in C?
Any real program has to do some of these things.
</p><p><hr>
<p>
<font face=Helvetica size=8 color=blue><b>A:</b></font>
Actually,
some standardization has occurred along the way.
In the beginning,
C did not have a standard library at all;
programmers always had to ``roll their own'' utility
routines.
After several abortive attempts,
a
certain
set
of library routines
(including the <TT>str*</TT>

and stdio families of routines)
became a <I>de facto</I> standard,
at least on Unix systems,
but the library was not
yet
a formal part of the language.
Vendors could
(and occasionally did)
provide completely different routines along with their compilers.
</p><p>In ANSI/ISO Standard C,
a library definition
(based on
the 1984 /usr/group standard,
and
largely compatible with
the traditional Unix library)
was adopted with as much standing as the language itself.
The Standard C library's treatment of file and device I/O is,
however,
rather
minimal.
It states how streams of characters are written to and read 
from files,
and it provides a few suggestions
about the
display
behavior of
control characters like <TT>\b</TT>, <TT>\r</TT>, and <TT>\t</TT>,
but beyond that it is silent.
(Many of these issues are, however,
addressed and standardized in Posix.)
</p><p>If the Standard were
to
attempt to define standard mechanisms for accessing
things like
keyboards and displays,
it
might seem to be a big convenience for programmers.

But it would be a monumental
task:
there is already a huge variety of display devices,
and huge variation among the operating systems through which 
they
are usually accessed.
We cannot assume that the years to come will offer any less 
variety.
</p><p>At one time the common output device for C programs was a Teletype;

later it was a
``dumb'' terminal,
after that it was a ``smart'' VT100 or other 
ANSI&nbsp;X3.64-compatible terminal
which today might be called ``dumb.''
Today

it's likely to be a bitmapped color display screen.
What will it be in five years?
How will the operating systems of that time deal with its capabilities?

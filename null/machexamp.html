<font face=Helvetica size=8 color=blue><b>Q:</b></font>
Seriously, have any actual machines really used nonzero null
pointers,
or different representations for pointers to different types?
</p><p><hr>

<font face=Helvetica size=8 color=blue><b>A:</b></font>

The Prime

50 series
used segment 07777, offset 0 for the null pointer,
at least for PL/I.
Later models used segment 0, offset 0 for null pointers in C,
necessitating new instructions such as TCNP (Test C Null Pointer),
evidently
as a sop to

<a href="sop.html" rel=subdocument>[footnote]</a>
all the extant poorly-written C code which made
incorrect assumptions.
Older, word-addressed Prime

machines

were also notorious for requiring larger

byte pointers (<TT>char&nbsp;*</TT>'s)
than word pointers (<TT>int&nbsp;*</TT>'s).
</p><p>

The
Eclipse MV series
from Data General has three architecturally
supported pointer formats (word, byte, and bit pointers),
two of which are used by C compilers:
byte pointers for <TT>char&nbsp;*</TT> and <TT>void&nbsp;*</TT>,
and word pointers for everything else.
For historical reasons during the evolution
of the 32-bit MV line from the 16-bit Nova line,
word pointers and byte pointers
had the offset, indirection, and ring protection bits
in different places in the word.
Passing a mismatched pointer format to a function
resulted in protection faults.
Eventually, the MV C compiler added many compatibility options
to try to deal with code that had pointer type mismatch errors.
</p><p>Some <TT>Honeywell-Bull</TT> mainframes use
the bit pattern 06000 for (internal) null pointers.
</p><p>

The CDC Cyber 180 Series has 48-bit pointers
consisting of a ring, segment, and offset.
Most users (in ring 11) have null pointers of 0xB00000000000.



It was common on old CDC ones-complement machines
to use an all-one-bits word as a special flag for all kinds of data,
including invalid addresses.
</p><p>


The old HP&nbsp;3000
series
uses a different addressing scheme for byte addresses
than for word addresses;
like several of the machines above
it therefore uses different representations
for <TT>char&nbsp;*</TT> and <TT>void&nbsp;*</TT> pointers
than for other pointers.
</p><p>

The Symbolics Lisp Machine, a tagged architecture,
does not even have conventional numeric pointers;
it uses the pair <TT>&lt;NIL,&nbsp;0&gt;</TT>
(basically a nonexistent <TT>&lt;</TT>object,&nbsp;offset<TT>&gt;</TT> handle)
as a C null pointer.
</p><p>Depending on the
``memory model'' in use,
8086-family


processors (PC compatibles) may use
16-bit data pointers
and
32-bit function pointers,
or vice versa.
</p><p>Some 64-bit Cray machines represent <TT>int&nbsp;*</TT>
in the lower 48 bits of a word;
<TT>char&nbsp;*</TT> additionally uses
some of
the upper 16 bits to indicate
a byte address within a word.

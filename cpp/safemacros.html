</h1>
<p>
<font face=Helvetica size=8 color=blue><b>Q:</b></font>
I'm trying to define
a few simple little function-like macros
such as
<pre>
	#define square(x) x * x
</pre>
but they're not always working.
</p><p><hr>
<p>
<font face=Helvetica size=8 color=blue><b>A:</b></font>
There are three important rules to remember when defining
function-like macros:
<OL><li>The macro expansion must always be parenthesized
to protect
any lower-precedence operators
from the surrounding expression.
Given the
(incorrect)
<TT>square()</TT> macro above,
the invocation
<pre>
	1 / square(n)
</pre>
would expand to
<pre>
	1 / n * n
</pre>
(which evaluates as <TT>(1 / n) * n</TT>),
while
what you want is
<pre>
	1 / (n * n)
</pre>
(In this case, the problem is one of associativity rather than 
precedence, but the effect is the same.)

<li>Within the macro definition,
all
occurrences
of the parameters
must be parenthesized
to protect
any low-precedence operators
in the actual arguments
from the
rest of the macro expansion.
Again
given the <TT>square()</TT> macro above,
the invocation
<pre>
	square(n + 1)
</pre>
would expand to
<pre>
	n + 1 * n + 1
</pre>
But what you want is
<pre>
	(n + 1) * (n + 1)
</pre>
<li>If a parameter appears several times
in the expansion,
the macro may not work properly
if the actual argument
is an expression with
side effects.
Yet again
given the <TT>square()</TT> macro above,
the invocation
<pre>
	square(i++)
</pre>
would expand to
<pre>
	i++ * i++
</pre>
which is undefined
(see question <a href="../expr/evalorder2.html">3.2</a>).
</OL></p><p>The proper definition of a <TT>square</TT> macro,
to comply with rules 1 and 2 above,
is
<pre>
	#define square(x) ((x) * (x))
</pre>
Complying 
with rule 3 is harder.
Sometimes,
careful exploitation of the short-circuiting behavior of
the
<TT>&amp;&amp;</TT>, <TT>||</TT>, or <TT>?:</TT>
operators
(see question <a href="../expr/shortcircuit.html">3.6</a>)
can arrange that a parameter which appears several times
is guaranteed to be evaluated exactly once.
Sometimes, the macro is

just
documented as being unsafe,
and callers must remember
not to use it on arguments with side effects.
Other times,
it may be advisable <em>not</em> to
compose a function-like macro
if it can't be made safe.
</p><p>(As a stylistic convention,
macros are often defined with capitalized or all-upper-case names,
to make it obvious that they are macros.
It may be acceptable to define a function-like macro
with an all-lower-case name,
if it truly simulates a function,
but only if it complies with all three rules above.
Since the squaring macro we've been discussing does not,
it should be defined as something like
<pre>
	#define Square(x) ((x) * (x))	/* UNSAFE */
</pre>
if it is to be used at all.)

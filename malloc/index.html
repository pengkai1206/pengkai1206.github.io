<H1>7. Memory Allocation</H1>

<p><a href="malloc1.html" rel=subdocument>7.1</a>
Why doesn't
this fragment
work?
<pre>
	char *answer;
	printf("Type something:\n");
	gets(answer);
	printf("You typed \"%s\"\n", answer);
</pre>
</p><p><a href="malloc2.html" rel=subdocument>7.2</a>
I can't get <TT>strcat</TT> to work.
I tried
<pre>
	char *s1 = "Hello, ";
	char *s2 = "world!";
	char *s3 = strcat(s1, s2);
</pre>
but I got strange results.
</p><p><a href="attitude.html" rel=subdocument>7.3</a>


But the
man page
for <TT>strcat</TT> says that
it takes two <TT>char&nbsp;*</TT>'s as arguments.
How am

I supposed to know to allocate things?
</p><p><a href="lucky.html" rel=subdocument>7.3b</a>
I just tried the code
<pre>
char *p;
strcpy(p, "abc");</pre>

and it worked.
How?
Why didn't it crash?
</p><p><a href="ptrvaralloc.html" rel=subdocument>7.3c</a>
How much memory does a pointer variable allocate?
</p><p><a href="linebfdur.html" rel=subdocument>7.4</a>
I'm
reading
lines from a file into an
array,
with this code:
<pre>
	char linebuf[80];
	char *lines[100];
	int i;

	for(i = 0; i &lt; 100; i++) {
		char *p = fgets(linebuf, 80, fp);
		if(p == NULL) break;
		lines[i] = p;
	}
</pre>
Why do all the lines end up containing copies of the last line?
</p><p><a href="retaggr.html" rel=subdocument>7.5a</a>
I have a function that is supposed to return a string,
but when it returns to its caller,
the returned string is garbage.
</p><p><a href="retaggr2.html" rel=subdocument>7.5b</a>
So what's the right way to return a string
or other aggregate?
</p><p><a href="decl.html" rel=subdocument>7.6</a>
Why am I getting
``warning: assignment of pointer from integer lacks a cast''
for calls to <TT>malloc</TT>?
</p><p><a href="cast.html" rel=subdocument>7.7</a>
Why does some code carefully cast the values returned by <TT>malloc</TT>
to the pointer type being allocated?
</p><p><a href="mallocnocast.html" rel=subdocument>7.7b</a>
What's wrong with casting <TT>malloc</TT>'s return value?
</p><p><a href="mallocnocast2.html" rel=subdocument>7.7c</a>
In a call to <TT>malloc</TT>,
what does an error like
``Cannot convert `<TT>void&nbsp;*</TT>' to `<TT>int&nbsp;*'''
mean?
</TT></p><p><a href="sizeofchar.html" rel=subdocument>7.8</a>
I see code like
<pre>
	char *p = malloc(strlen(s) + 1);
	strcpy(p, s);
</pre>
Shouldn't that be <TT>malloc((strlen(s) + 1) * sizeof(char))</TT>?
</p><p><a href="mymallocretp.html" rel=subdocument>7.9</a>
I wrote a little wrapper around <TT>malloc</TT>,
but it doesn't work:
<pre>
	#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;
	#include &lt;stdlib.h&gt;

	mymalloc(void *retp, size_t size)
	{
		retp = malloc(size);
		if(retp == NULL) {
			fprintf(stderr, "out of memory\n");
			exit(EXIT_FAILURE);
		}
	}
</pre>
</p><p><a href="mimic3.html" rel=subdocument>7.10</a>
I'm trying to declare a pointer and allocate some space for it,
but it's
not working.
What's wrong with
this code?
<pre>
char *p;
*p = malloc(10);</pre>


</p><p><a href="fcninit2.html" rel=subdocument>7.10a</a>
What's wrong with
this initialization?
<pre>
char *p = malloc(10);</pre>

My compiler is complaining about
an ``invalid initializer'',
or something.

</p><p><a href="lintpalign2.html" rel=subdocument>7.10b</a>
How can I shut off the
``warning: possible pointer alignment problem''
message
which
<TT>lint</TT> gives me for each call to <TT>malloc</TT>?

</p><p><a href="dynarray2.html" rel=subdocument>7.11</a>
How can I dynamically allocate arrays?
</p><p><a href="memavail2.html" rel=subdocument>7.12</a>
How can I find out how much memory is available?

</p><p><a href="malloc0xref.html" rel=subdocument>7.13</a>
What should <TT>malloc(0)</TT> do?
Return a null pointer or a pointer to 0 bytes?

</p><p><a href="lazyalloc.html" rel=subdocument>7.14</a>
I've heard that some operating systems

don't actually allocate <TT>malloc</TT>'ed memory
until
the

program tries to
use
it.
Is this legal?
</p><p><a href="sizetlong.html" rel=subdocument>7.15</a>
<TT>malloc</TT>
is
returning crazy pointer values,
but I <em>did</em> read question <a href="decl.html">7.6</a>
and I have included the line
<pre>
	extern void *malloc();
</pre>
before I call it.
</p><p><a href="sizewrap.html" rel=subdocument>7.16</a>
I'm allocating a large array for some numeric work,
using the line
<pre>
	double *array = malloc(300 * 300 * sizeof(double));
</pre>
<TT>malloc</TT> isn't returning null,
but
the program is acting strangely,
as if it's overwriting memory,
or <TT>malloc</TT> isn't allocating as much as I asked for,
or something.
</p><p><a href="segment.html" rel=subdocument>7.17</a>
I've got 8 meg of memory in my PC.
Why can I only seem to <TT>malloc</TT> 640K or so?
</p><p><a href="efficiency.html" rel=subdocument>7.18</a>
My application depends heavily on
dynamic allocation of nodes for data structures,
and <TT>malloc</TT>/<TT>free</TT> overhead
is
becoming
a bottleneck.
What can
I do?
</p><p><a href="crash.html" rel=subdocument>7.19</a>
My program is crashing, apparently somewhere down inside
<TT>malloc</TT>,
but I can't see anything wrong with it.
Is there a bug in <TT>malloc</TT>?
</p><p><a href="noscale.html" rel=subdocument>7.19b</a>
</p><p>I'm dynamically allocating an array, like this:
<pre>
	int *iarray = (int *)malloc(nints);
</pre>
<TT>malloc</TT> isn't returning NULL,
but the code isn't working.
</p><p><a href="useafterfree.html" rel=subdocument>7.20</a>
You can't use dynamically-allocated memory after you free it, can you?
</p><p><a href="ptrafterfree.html" rel=subdocument>7.21</a>
Why isn't a pointer
null
after calling
<TT>free</TT>?

<br>
How unsafe is it to use
(assign, compare)
a pointer value after it's been freed?
</p><p><a href="local.html" rel=subdocument>7.22</a>
When I call <TT>malloc</TT> to allocate memory for a
pointer which is local to a function,
do I have to explicitly <TT>free</TT> it?
</p><p><a href="freeforall.html" rel=subdocument>7.23</a>
I'm allocating structures which contain pointers to other
dynamically-allocated objects.
When I free
a structure,
do I
also
have to free each subsidiary pointer?
</p><p><a href="freeb4exit.html" rel=subdocument>7.24</a>
Must I free allocated memory before the program exits?
</p><p><a href="freetoOS.html" rel=subdocument>7.25</a>
I have a program which <TT>malloc</TT>s
and later
<TT>free</TT>s a lot
of memory,
but
I can see from the operating system
that
memory usage
doesn't
actually
go back down.
</p><p><a href="freesize.html" rel=subdocument>7.26</a>
How does <TT>free</TT> know how many bytes to free?

</p><p><a href="querysize.html" rel=subdocument>7.27</a>
So can I query the malloc package to find out how big an
allocated block is?
</p><p><a href="sizeof.html" rel=subdocument>7.28</a>
Why doesn't <TT>sizeof</TT> tell me the size of
the block of memory pointed to by a pointer?
</p><p><a href="realloc.html" rel=subdocument>7.29</a>
Having dynamically allocated an array
(as in question <a href="../aryptr/dynarray.html">6.14</a>),
can I change its size?
</p><p><a href="reallocnull.html" rel=subdocument>7.30</a>
Is it legal to pass a null pointer as the first argument to <TT>realloc</TT>?
Why would you want to?
</p><p><a href="calloc.html" rel=subdocument>7.31</a>
What's the difference between <TT>calloc</TT> and <TT>malloc</TT>?
Which should I

use?

Is it safe to take advantage of <TT>calloc</TT>'s
zero-filling?
Does <TT>free</TT> work
on memory allocated with <TT>calloc</TT>,
or do you

need a <TT>cfree</TT>?
</p><p><a href="alloca.html" rel=subdocument>7.32</a>
What is <TT>alloca</TT> and why is its use discouraged?

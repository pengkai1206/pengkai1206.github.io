<p>
Believe it or not, you're the first to have asked, so you get to
be the first to hear me apologize for the fact that several
elaborate discussions of those "wacky ideas" which I've written
at various times are in fact stuck off in my magtape archives
somewhere, not readily accessible.
<br>
[The two main ones I was probably thinking of are
<a href="invvarargs.19890604.html">this one</a>
and
<a href="invvarargs.19920714.html">this one</a>.]
<p>
Here is an outline; I'll try to find one of my longer old
descriptions and send it later.
<p>
The basic idea is to postulate the existence of the following
routine:
<p><pre><TT>
	#include &lt;stdarg.h&gt;

	callg(funcp, argp)
	int (*funcp)();
	magic_arglist_pointer argp;
</TT></pre><p>
This routine calls the function pointed to by <TT>funcp</TT>, passing to
it the argument list pointed to by <TT>argp</TT>.  It returns whatever the
pointed-to function returns.
<p>
The second question is of course how to construct the argument
list pointed to by <TT>argp</TT>.  I've had a number of ideas over the
years on how to do this; perhaps the best (or at least the one
I'm currently happiest with) is to do something like this:
<p><pre><TT>
	extern func();
	va_alloc(arglist, 10);
	va_list argp;

	va_start2(arglist, argp);

	va_arg(argp, int) = 1;
	va_arg(argp, double) = 2.3;
	va_arg(argp, char *) = "four";

	va_finish2(arglist, argp);

	callg(func, arglist);
</TT></pre><p>
The above is equivalent to the simple call
<p><pre><TT>
	func(1, 2.3, "four");
</TT></pre><p>
Now, the interesting thing is that it's often (perhaps even
"usually") possible to construct <TT>va_alloc</TT>, <TT>va_start2</TT>, and
<TT>va_finish2</TT> macros such as I've illustrated above such that the
standard <TT>va_arg</TT> macro out of <TT>&lt;stdarg.h&gt;</TT> or <TT>&lt;varargs.h&gt;</TT> does the
real work.  (In other words, the traditional implementations of
<TT>va_arg</TT> would in fact work in an lvalue context, i.e. on the left
hand side of an assignment.)
<p>
I'm fairly sure I've got working versions of macros along the
lines of <TT>va_alloc</TT>, <TT>va_start2</TT>, and <TT>va_finish2</TT> macros somewhere,
but I can't find them at the moment, either.  At the <a href="invvarargs.19930307.html#end">end of this
message</a> I'll append a <a href="varargs2.h">different set of macros</a>, not predicated on
the assumption of being able to re-use the existing <TT>va_arg</TT> on the
left hand side, which should serve as an example of the essential
implementation ideas.
<p>
A third question is what to do if the return type (not just the
argument list) of the called function is not known at compile
time.  (If you're still with me, we're moving in the direction of
doing so much at run time that we've practically stopped
compiling and started interpreting, and in fact many of the ideas
I'm discussing in this note come out of my attempts to write a
full-blown C interpreter.)  We can answer the third question by
adding a third argument to our hypothetical <TT>callg()</TT> routine,
involving a tag describing the type of result we expect and a
union in which any return value can be stored.
<p>
A fourth question is how to write this hypothetical <TT>callg()</TT>
function.  It is one of my favorite examples of a function that
essentially must be written in assembler, not for efficiency, but
because it's something you simply can't do in C.  It's actually
not terribly hard to write; I've got implementations of it for
most of the machines I use.  I write it for a new environment by
compiling a simple little program fragment such as
<p><pre><TT>
	int nargs;
	int args[10];
	int (*funcp)();
	int i;

	switch(nargs)
		{
		case 0:	(*funcp)();
			break;

		case 1:	(*funcp)(args[0]);
			break;

		case 2:	(*funcp)(args[0], args[1]);
			break;

		...

	for(i = 0; i &lt; nargs; i++)
		(*funcp)(args[i]);
</TT></pre><p>
, and massaging the assembly language output to push a variable
number of arguments before performing the (single) call.  It's
possible to do this without knowing very much else about the
assembly/machine language in use.  (It helps a lot to have a
compiler output or listing option which lets you see the its
generated assembly language.)
<p>
When I say it's generally easy to write <TT>callg</TT>, I'm thinking of
conventional, stack-based machines.  Some modern machines pass
some or all arguments in registers, and which registers are used
can depend on the type of the arguments, which makes this sort of
thing much harder.
<p>
A fifth question is where my name "callg" comes from.  The VAX has a
single instruction, CALLG, which does exactly what you want here. 
(In other words, an assembly-language implementation of this
<TT>callg()</TT> routine is a single line of assembler on the VAX.)
I've also used the name <TT>va_call</TT> instead of <TT>callg</TT>.
<p>
If you have questions or comments prompted by any of this, or if
you'd like to see more code fragments, feel free to ask.

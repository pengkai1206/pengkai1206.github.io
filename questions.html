<H4>1. Declarations and Initializations</H4>
<p><a href="decl/inttypes.html" rel=subdocument>1.1</a>

How should I decide which integer type to use?
</p><p><a href="decl/exactsizes.html" rel=subdocument>1.2</a>
Why aren't the sizes of the standard types precisely defined?
</p><p><a href="decl/int16.html" rel=subdocument>1.3</a>
Since C doesn't define sizes exactly,
I've been using
typedefs
like <TT>int16</TT> and
<TT>int32</TT>.
I can then define these typedefs
to be <TT>int</TT>, <TT>short</TT>, <TT>long</TT>,
etc. depending on what machine I'm using.

That should solve everything, right?
</p><p><a href="decl/octabyte.html" rel=subdocument>1.4</a>
What should the 64-bit type be
on a
machine that can support it?
</p><p><a href="decl/charstarws.html" rel=subdocument>1.5</a>
What's wrong with
this
declaration?
<pre>
char* p1, p2;</pre>




I get errors when I try to
use
<TT>p2</TT>.
</p><p><a href="decl/mimic.html" rel=subdocument>1.6</a>
I'm trying to declare a pointer and allocate some space for it,
but it's
not working.
What's wrong with
this code?
<pre>
char *p;
*p = malloc(10);</pre>


</p><p><a href="decl/decldef.html" rel=subdocument>1.7</a>
What's the best way to declare and define
global variables
and functions?
</p><p><a href="decl/opaque.html" rel=subdocument>1.8</a>
How can I implement
opaque (abstract) data types in C?

</p><p><a href="decl/semiglobal.html" rel=subdocument>1.9</a>
How can I make a sort of ``semi-global'' variable,
that is,
one that's
private to a few functions spread across a few source files?
</p><p><a href="decl/static.html" rel=subdocument>1.10</a>
Do
all
declarations for
the same
<TT>static</TT> function
or variable
have to include the storage class <TT>static</TT>?
</p><p><a href="decl/extern.html" rel=subdocument>1.11</a>
What does <TT>extern</TT> mean in a function declaration?
</p><p><a href="decl/auto.html" rel=subdocument>1.12</a>
What's the <TT>auto</TT> keyword good for?
</p><p><a href="decl/typedefvsdefine.html" rel=subdocument>1.13</a>
What's the difference between using a <TT>typedef</TT>
or

a <TT>#define</TT>
for a user-defined type?
</p><p><a href="decl/selfrefstruct.html" rel=subdocument>1.14</a>

I can't seem to define a linked list
successfully.
I tried
<pre>
	typedef struct {
		char *item;
		NODEPTR next;
	} *NODEPTR;
</pre>
but the compiler gave me error messages.
Can't a structure in C contain a pointer to itself?

</p><p><a href="decl/mutrefstructs.html" rel=subdocument>1.15</a>
How can I define a pair of mutually referential structures?
I tried
<pre>
	typedef struct {
		int afield;
		BPTR bpointer;
	} *APTR;

	typedef struct {
		int bfield;
		APTR apointer;
	} *BPTR;
</pre>
but the compiler doesn't know about
<TT>BPTR</TT>
when it is used in
the first structure declaration.
</p><p><a href="decl/structtypdf.html" rel=subdocument>1.16</a>
What's the difference between
these two declarations?
<pre>
	struct x1 { ... };
	typedef struct { ... } x2;
</pre>

</p><p><a href="decl/pfitypedef.html" rel=subdocument>1.17</a>
What does
<pre>
typedef int (*funcptr)();</pre>

mean?
</p><p><a href="decl/typdfcnst.html" rel=subdocument>1.18</a>
I've got
the declarations
<pre>
	typedef char *charp;
	const charp p;
</pre>
Why is <TT>p</TT> turning out <TT>const</TT>,
instead of the characters pointed to?

</p><p><a href="decl/constasconst.html" rel=subdocument>1.19</a>
I don't understand why I can't
use <TT>const</TT> values in initializers and array
dimensions,
as in
<pre>
	const int n = 5;
	int a[n];
</pre>

</p><p><a href="decl/constptrconst.html" rel=subdocument>1.20</a>
What's the difference between
<TT>const&nbsp;char&nbsp;*p</TT>,
<TT>char&nbsp;const&nbsp;*p</TT>,
and <TT>char&nbsp;*&nbsp;const&nbsp;p</TT>?

</p><p><a href="decl/constparm.html" rel=subdocument>1.20b</a>





</p><p>What does it mean for a function parameter to be <TT>const</TT>?
What do the two <TT>const</TT>'s in
<pre>
	int f(const * const p)
</pre>
mean?
</p><p><a href="decl/cdecl1.html" rel=subdocument>1.21</a>
How do I
construct
declarations of complicated types such as
``array of N pointers to functions returning
pointers to functions returning pointers
to <TT>char</TT>'',
or figure out what similarly complicated declarations mean?
</p><p><a href="decl/recurfuncp.html" rel=subdocument>1.22</a>



How can I declare a function

that can return
a pointer to a function
of the same type?
I'm building a state machine with one function
for each state, each of which returns a pointer to the function for
the next state.
But I can't find a way to declare the
functions--I seem
to need a function
returning a pointer to a function
returning a pointer to a function
returning a pointer to a function...,
ad infinitum.
</p><p><a href="decl/dynarray.html" rel=subdocument>1.23</a>
Can I declare a local array
(or parameter array)
of a size matching a passed-in array,
or set by another parameter?
</p><p><a href="decl/extarraysize.html" rel=subdocument>1.24</a>
I have an <TT>extern</TT> array
which is defined
in
one file,
and used in another:
<pre>
<I>file1.c:</I>			<I>file2.c:</I>

int array[] = {1, 2, 3};	extern int array[];
</pre>
Why doesn't <TT>sizeof</TT> work on
<TT>array</TT> in <TT>file2.c</TT>?
</p><p><a href="decl/implfdecl.html" rel=subdocument>1.25</a>
My compiler is complaining
about an invalid redeclaration of a function,
but I only define it once
and call it once.

</p><p><a href="decl/main.html" rel=subdocument>1.25b</a>
What's the right declaration for <TT>main</TT>?
<br>Is <TT>void&nbsp;main()</TT> correct?
</p><p><a href="decl/argpromo.html" rel=subdocument>1.26</a>
My compiler is complaining about mismatched function prototypes
which look fine to me.
</p><p><a href="decl/headerglom.html" rel=subdocument>1.27</a>
I'm getting strange
syntax errors
on the very first
declaration in
a file,
but it looks fine.


</p><p><a href="decl/bigdatastr.html" rel=subdocument>1.28</a>
My compiler isn't letting me declare a big array

like
<pre>
double array[256][256];</pre>

</p><p><a href="decl/namespace.html" rel=subdocument>1.29</a>
How can I determine
which identifiers are safe for me to use
and which are reserved?
</p><p><a href="decl/initval.html" rel=subdocument>1.30</a>
What
am I allowed to
assume about the initial values of variables
and arrays
which are not explicitly initialized?
<br>If global variables start out as ``zero'',
is that good enough
for null pointers and floating-point zeroes?
</p><p><a href="decl/autoaggrinit.html" rel=subdocument>1.31</a>
This code, straight out of a book, isn't compiling:
<pre>
int f()
{
	char a[] = "Hello, world!";
}
</pre>
</p><p><a href="decl/fcninit.html" rel=subdocument>1.31b</a>
What's wrong with
this initialization?
<pre>
char *p = malloc(10);</pre>

My compiler is complaining about
an ``invalid initializer'',
or something.
</p><p><a href="decl/strlitinit.html" rel=subdocument>1.32</a>
What is the difference between
these initializations?
<pre>
char a[] = "string literal";
char *p  = "string literal";
</pre>
My program
crashes if
I try to
assign a new value to <TT>p[i]</TT>.
</p><p><a href="decl/nonstring.html" rel=subdocument>1.33</a>
Is <TT>char&nbsp;a[3]&nbsp;=&nbsp;"abc";</TT> legal?
</p><p><a href="decl/ptrfuncinit.html" rel=subdocument>1.34</a>
I finally figured out the syntax for declaring pointers to
functions, but now how do I initialize one?
</p><p><a href="decl/initunion.html" rel=subdocument>1.35</a>
Can I initialize unions?

</p><hr>
<H4>2. Structures, Unions, and Enumerations</H4>
<p><a href="struct/typedef.html" rel=subdocument>2.1</a>
What's the difference between
these two declarations?
<pre>
	struct x1 { ... };
	typedef struct { ... } x2;
</pre>
</p><p><a href="struct/impltypedef.html" rel=subdocument>2.2</a>
Why doesn't
<pre>
struct x { ... };
x thestruct;</pre>

work?
</p><p><a href="struct/selfref.html" rel=subdocument>2.3</a>
Can a structure contain a pointer
to itself?
</p><p><a href="struct/opaquetypes.html" rel=subdocument>2.4</a>
How can I implement
opaque (abstract) data types in C?
</p><p><a href="struct/oop.html" rel=subdocument>2.4b</a>
Is there a good way of simulating OOP-style inheritance,
or other OOP features,
in C?
</p><p><a href="struct/fcnproto.html" rel=subdocument>2.5</a>
Why does the declaration
<pre>
extern int f(struct x *p);</pre>

give me
an obscure
warning message
about
``struct x declared inside parameter list''?

</p><p><a href="struct/structhack.html" rel=subdocument>2.6</a>
I came across some code that declared a structure
like this:
<pre>
struct name {
	int namelen;
	char namestr[1];
};
</pre>
and then did some tricky allocation to make
the
<TT>namestr</TT>
array act like it
had several elements,
with the number
recorded by <TT>namelen</TT>.
How does this work?
Is
it
legal or portable?
</p><p><a href="struct/firstclass.html" rel=subdocument>2.7</a>
I heard
that structures could be assigned
to variables and passed to and from functions, but K&amp;R1
says
not.

</p><p><a href="struct/compare.html" rel=subdocument>2.8</a>
Is there a way to
compare structures
automatically?
</p><p><a href="struct/passret.html" rel=subdocument>2.9</a>
How
are
structure passing and returning
implemented?
</p><p><a href="struct/anonstruct.html" rel=subdocument>2.10</a>
How can
I pass constant values to functions which accept structure arguments?
How can I create nameless, immediate, constant structure values?
</p><p><a href="struct/io.html" rel=subdocument>2.11</a>
How can I read/write structures from/to

data files?

</p><p><a href="struct/padding.html" rel=subdocument>2.12</a>
Why is my
compiler
leaving holes in structures,
wasting space
and preventing

``binary'' I/O to external data
files?
Can
I turn
this
off,
or otherwise control the alignment of structure fields?

</p><p><a href="struct/endpad.html" rel=subdocument>2.13</a>
Why does <TT>sizeof</TT> report a larger size than I expect for a
structure type,
as if there were padding at the end?
</p><p><a href="struct/offsetof.html" rel=subdocument>2.14</a>
How can I determine the byte offset of a field within a structure?
</p><p><a href="struct/fieldnames.html" rel=subdocument>2.15</a>
How can I access structure fields by name at run time?
</p><p><a href="struct/withxref.html" rel=subdocument>2.16</a>
Does C have an equivalent to Pascal's
<TT>with</TT> statement?

</p><p><a href="struct/decay.html" rel=subdocument>2.17</a>
If an array name acts like a pointer to the base of an array,
why isn't the same thing true of a structure?
</p><p><a href="struct/retcrash.html" rel=subdocument>2.18</a>
This program
works correctly, but
it
dumps core
after it
finishes.
Why?
<pre>
	struct list {
		char *item;
		struct list *next;
	}

	/* Here is the main program. */

	main(argc, argv)
	{ ... }
</pre>

</p><p><a href="struct/union.html" rel=subdocument>2.19</a>
What's the difference between a structure and a union, anyway?
</p><p><a href="struct/initunion.html" rel=subdocument>2.20</a>
Can I initialize unions?
</p><p><a href="struct/taggedunion.html" rel=subdocument>2.21</a>
Is there an automatic way
to keep track of which field of a union is in use?
</p><p><a href="struct/enumvsdefine.html" rel=subdocument>2.22</a>
What's the difference between
an enumeration and a set of
preprocessor <TT>#define</TT>s?
</p><p><a href="struct/enumport.html" rel=subdocument>2.23</a>
Are enumerations really portable?
<br>Aren't they Pascalish?
<br>
</p><p><a href="struct/enumprint.html" rel=subdocument>2.24</a>
Is there an easy way to print enumeration values symbolically?
</p><p><a href="struct/bitfield0.html" rel=subdocument>2.25</a>
I came across some structure declarations with colons and 
numbers next to certain
fields,
like this:
<pre>
struct record {
	char *name;
	int refcount : 4;
	unsigned dirty : 1;
};
</pre>
What gives?
</p><p><a href="struct/bitfields.html" rel=subdocument>2.26</a>
Why do people use explicit masks and
bit-twiddling
code so much,
instead of declaring bit-fields?
</p><hr>
<H4>3. Expressions</H4>
<p><a href="expr/evalorder1.html" rel=subdocument>3.1</a>
Why doesn't
this code:

<pre>
a[i] = i++;</pre>

work?
</p><p><a href="expr/evalorder2.html" rel=subdocument>3.2</a>
Under my compiler, the code
<pre>
int i&nbsp;=&nbsp;7;
printf("%d\n",&nbsp;i++&nbsp;*&nbsp;i++);</pre>

prints 49.
Regardless of the order of evaluation, shouldn't it print 56?
</p><p><a href="expr/ieqiplusplus.html" rel=subdocument>3.3</a>
I've experimented with
the code
<pre>
int i&nbsp;=&nbsp;3;
i&nbsp;=&nbsp;i++;</pre>

on several compilers.
Some gave <TT>i</TT> the

value 3,
and
some gave 4.
Which compiler is correct?
</p><p><a href="expr/xorswapexpr.html" rel=subdocument>3.3b</a>
Here's a slick expression:
<pre>
a&nbsp;^=&nbsp;b&nbsp;^=&nbsp;a&nbsp;^=&nbsp;b</pre>

It swaps <TT>a</TT> and <TT>b</TT> without using a temporary.
</p><p><a href="expr/precvsooe.html" rel=subdocument>3.4</a>
Can I use explicit parentheses to force
the order of evaluation I want,
and control these side effects?
Even if I don't, doesn't precedence dictate it?
</p><p><a href="expr/seqpointops.html" rel=subdocument>3.5</a>
But what about the
<TT>&amp;&amp;</TT>
and
<TT>||</TT>


operators?
<br>I see code like 
``<TT>while((c&nbsp;=&nbsp;getchar())&nbsp;!=&nbsp;EOF&nbsp;&amp;&amp;&nbsp;c&nbsp;!=&nbsp;'\n')</TT>'' ...
</p><p><a href="expr/shortcircuit.html" rel=subdocument>3.6</a>
Is it safe to assume
that the right-hand side
of the
<TT>&amp;&amp;</TT>
and
<TT>||</TT>
operators
won't be evaluated
if the left-hand side determines the outcome?
</p><p><a href="expr/comma.html" rel=subdocument>3.7</a>
Why did
<pre>
printf("%d&nbsp;%d",&nbsp;f1(),&nbsp;f2());</pre>

call <TT>f2</TT> first?
I thought the comma operator guaranteed left-to-right evaluation.
</p><p><a href="expr/seqpoints.html" rel=subdocument>3.8</a>
How can I understand
complex expressions like the ones in this section,
and avoid writing undefined ones?
What's a ``sequence point''?
</p><p><a href="expr/evalorder4.html" rel=subdocument>3.9</a>
So
if I write
<pre>
a[i]&nbsp;=&nbsp;i++;</pre>

and I don't care

which cell of <TT>a[]</TT> gets written to,
the code is fine,
and <TT>i</TT> gets
incremented by one,
right?

</p><p><a href="expr/experiment.html" rel=subdocument>3.10a</a>
People keep saying that the behavior
of <TT>i&nbsp;=&nbsp;i++</TT>
is undefined,
but
I just tried
it
on an ANSI-conforming compiler,
and got the results I expected.

</p><p><a href="expr/expec0.html" rel=subdocument>3.10b</a>
People told me that if I evaluated an undefined expression,
or accessed an uninitialized variable,
I'd get a random, garbage value.
But I tried it, and got <em>zero</em>.
What's up with that?
</p><p><a href="expr/confused.html" rel=subdocument>3.11</a>
How can I avoid these undefined evaluation order difficulties
if I don't feel like learning the complicated rules?
</p><p><a href="expr/prevspost.html" rel=subdocument>3.12a</a>
What's the difference between <TT>++i</TT> and <TT>i++</TT>?
</p><p><a href="expr/plusplus.html" rel=subdocument>3.12b</a>
If I'm not using the value of the expression,
should I use <TT>++i</TT> or <TT>i++</TT> to increment a variable?
</p><p><a href="expr/transitivity.html" rel=subdocument>3.13</a>
I need to check whether one number lies between two others.
Why doesn't
<pre>
if(a &lt; b &lt; c)</pre>

work?
</p><p><a href="expr/intoverflow1.html" rel=subdocument>3.14</a>
Why doesn't the code
<pre>
int&nbsp;a&nbsp;=&nbsp;1000,&nbsp;b&nbsp;=&nbsp;1000;
long&nbsp;int&nbsp;c&nbsp;=&nbsp;a&nbsp;*&nbsp;b;</pre>

work?
</p><p><a href="expr/intovf3.html" rel=subdocument>3.14b</a>
How can I ensure that integer arithmetic doesn't overflow?

</p><p><a href="expr/truncation1.html" rel=subdocument>3.15</a>
Why does the code
<pre>
double degC, degF;
degC = 5 / 9 * (degF - 32);</pre>

keep giving me 0?
</p><p><a href="expr/qcolonlhs.html" rel=subdocument>3.16</a>
I have a complicated expression which
I have
to assign
to one 
of two variables,
depending on a condition.
Can I use code like this?
<pre>
	((condition) ? a : b) = complicated_expression;
</pre>
</p><p><a href="expr/ternprec.html" rel=subdocument>3.17</a>
I have
some code
containing expressions
like
<pre>
a ? b = c : d</pre>

and some compilers are accepting it but some are not.
</p><p><a href="expr/unswarn.html" rel=subdocument>3.18</a>
What does the warning
``semantics of `<TT>&gt;</TT>' change in ANSI C''
mean?
</p><p><a href="expr/preservingrules.html" rel=subdocument>3.19</a>
What's the difference between the ``unsigned preserving''
and ``value preserving'' rules?
</p><hr>
<H4>4. Pointers</H4>
<p><a href="ptrs/goodfor.html" rel=subdocument>4.1</a>
What are pointers really good for, anyway?
</p><p><a href="ptrs/mimic.html" rel=subdocument>4.2</a>
I'm trying to declare a pointer and allocate some space for it,
but it's
not working.
What's wrong with
this code?
<pre>
char *p;
*p = malloc(10);</pre>

</p><p><a href="ptrs/unopprec2.html" rel=subdocument>4.3</a>
Does <TT>*p++</TT> increment <TT>p</TT>,
or what it points to?
</p><p><a href="ptrs/explscale.html" rel=subdocument>4.4</a>
I'm
trying to use
pointers to
manipulate an array of <TT>int</TT>s.

What's wrong with this code?
<pre>
	int array[5], i, *ip;
	for(i = 0; i &lt; 5; i++) array[i] = i;
	ip = array;
	printf("%d\n", *(ip + 3 * sizeof(int)));
</pre>
I expected the last line to print 3,
but it printed garbage.
</p><p><a href="ptrs/castincr.html" rel=subdocument>4.5</a>
I
have
a <TT>char&nbsp;*</TT> pointer
that happens to point to
some <TT>int</TT>s,
and I want to step it over them.
Why doesn't
<pre>
((int *)p)++;</pre>

work?
</p><p><a href="ptrs/voidparith.html" rel=subdocument>4.6</a>
Why can't I perform arithmetic on a <TT>void&nbsp;*</TT> pointer?

</p><p><a href="ptrs/align.html" rel=subdocument>4.7</a>
I've got some code that's trying to unpack external structures, 
but it's crashing
with a message about an ``unaligned access.''
What does this mean?
</p><p><a href="ptrs/passptrinit.html" rel=subdocument>4.8</a>
I have a function which accepts,
and is supposed to initialize,
a pointer:
<pre>
	void f(int *ip)
	{
		static int dummy = 5;
		ip = &amp;dummy;
	}
</pre>
But when I call it like this:
<pre>
	int *ip;
	f(ip);
</pre>
the
pointer in the caller remains unchanged.
</p><p><a href="ptrs/genericpp.html" rel=subdocument>4.9</a>
Suppose I want to write a function that takes a generic pointer
as an argument and I want to simulate passing it by reference.
Can I give the formal parameter type <TT>void&nbsp;**</TT>,
and do something like this?
<pre>
	void f(void **);
	double *dp;
	f((void **)&amp;dp);
</pre>
</p><p><a href="ptrs/refconst.html" rel=subdocument>4.10</a>
I have a function
<pre>
	extern int f(int *);
</pre>
which accepts a pointer to an <TT>int</TT>.
How can I pass a constant
by reference?
A call like
<pre>
	f(&amp;5);
</pre>
doesn't seem to work.
</p><p><a href="ptrs/passbyref.html" rel=subdocument>4.11</a>
Does C even have ``pass by reference''?
</p><p><a href="ptrs/funccall.html" rel=subdocument>4.12</a>
I've seen different syntax used for calling functions via pointers.
What's the story?
</p><p><a href="ptrs/generic.html" rel=subdocument>4.13</a>
What's the total generic pointer type?
My compiler complained
when I tried to stuff function pointers into a <TT>void&nbsp;*</TT>.
</p><p><a href="ptrs/int2ptr.html" rel=subdocument>4.14</a>
How are integers converted to and from pointers?
Can I temporarily stuff an integer into a pointer,

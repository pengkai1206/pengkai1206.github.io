<H1>17. Style</H1>

<p><a href="layout.html" rel=subdocument>17.1</a>

What's the best style for code layout in C?

</p><p><a href="srcfiles.html" rel=subdocument>17.2</a>
How should functions be apportioned among source files?
</p><p><a href="strcmp.html" rel=subdocument>17.3</a>
Here's a neat trick for checking whether two strings are equal:
<pre>
if(!strcmp(s1, s2))</pre>

Is this
good style?
</p><p><a href="revtest.html" rel=subdocument>17.4</a>
Why do some people write
<TT>if(0&nbsp;==&nbsp;x)</TT>
instead of
<TT>if(x&nbsp;==&nbsp;0)</TT>?
</p><p><a href="protomacro.html" rel=subdocument>17.4b</a>
I've seen function declarations that look like this:
<pre>
extern int func __((int, int));</pre>

What are those
extra parentheses and underscores
for?
</p><p><a href="voidcasts.html" rel=subdocument>17.5</a>
I came across some code that
puts
a <TT>(void)</TT> cast before
each
call to <TT>printf</TT>.

Why?
</p><p><a href="nullor0.html" rel=subdocument>17.6</a>
If <TT>NULL</TT> and <TT>0</TT> are equivalent
as null pointer constants,
which should I use?
</p><p><a href="bool.html" rel=subdocument>17.7</a>
Should I use symbolic names like <TT>TRUE</TT>
and <TT>FALSE</TT> for Boolean constants,
or plain 1 and 0?

</p><p><a href="hungarian.html" rel=subdocument>17.8</a>
What is ``Hungarian Notation''?
Is it worthwhile?
</p><p><a href="guides.html" rel=subdocument>17.9</a>
Where can I get the
``Indian Hill Style Guide''
and other
coding standards?
</p><p><a href="stylewars.html" rel=subdocument>17.10</a>
Some people say that <TT>goto</TT>'s are evil
and that I should never use them.
Isn't that a bit extreme?
</p><p><a href="vsefficiency.html" rel=subdocument>17.11</a>

People always say that good style is important,
but when they go out of their way
to use clear techniques
and make their programs readable,
they seem to end up with less efficient programs.
Since efficiency is so important,
isn't it
necessary
to sacrifice some style and
readability?
</p><p><a href="charstarws2.html" rel=subdocument>17.12</a>
Which is correct,
<pre>
char&nbsp;*p</pre>

or
<pre>
char*&nbsp;p</pre>
?

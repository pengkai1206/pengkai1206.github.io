Back in July of 1995,
Adam Moscowitz posed this question to Dennis Ritchie:
<p>
<blockquote>
I teach C programming classes, and I'm often asked why C has a bitwise
exclusive-OR operator but not a logical one. Is this simply an
historical accident, or was there a specific reason it was omitted?
Also, is there any reason why the C9x committee shouldn't consider
adding it to the standard?

Dennis replied:
<p>
I've often been asked this in person, and it comes up on netnews too.
Since I formulated a mildly coherent answer, I'm sending it along
to Steve in case a suitably edited version is suitable for the C FAQ.

Answer:
<p>
There are both historical and practical reasons why there is no <TT>^^</TT> operator.
<p>
The practical is: there's not much use for the operator.  The main point
of <TT>&amp;&amp;</TT> and <TT>||</TT> is to take advantage of their short-circuit evaluation not
only for efficiency reasons, but more often for expressiveness and correctness.
For example, in
<pre>
	if (cond1() &amp;&amp; cond2()) ...
</pre>
it is often important that <TT>cond1()</TT> is done first, because if it's false
<TT>cond2()</TT> may not be well defined, or because <TT>cond1()</TT> is cheap and
<TT>cond2()</TT> is expensive.  Syntax to handle the situation has made it into lots
of languages; compare Ada's `and then'.
<p>
By contrast, an <TT>^^</TT> operator would always force evaluation of both arms
of the expression, so there's no efficiency gain.  Furthermore, situations
in which <TT>^^</TT> is really called for are pretty rare, though examples can
be created.  These situations get rarer and stranger as you
stack up the operator--
<pre>
	if (cond1() ^^ cond2() ^^ cond3() ^^ ...) ...
</pre>
does the consequent exactly when an odd number of the
<TT>condx()</TT>s are true.   By contrast, the <TT>&amp;&amp;</TT> and <TT>||</TT> analogs remain
fairly plausible and useful.
<p>
Historical:  C's predecessors (B and BCPL) had only the bitwise
versions of <TT>|</TT> <TT>&amp;</TT> <TT>^</TT>.   They also had a special rule, namely that
in an statement like
<pre>
	if (a &amp; b) ...
</pre>
the `<TT>&amp;</TT>', being at the `top level' of the expression occurring  in
`truth-value context' (inside the <TT>if()</TT>)  was interpreted just
like C's <TT>&amp;&amp;</TT>.  Similarly for <TT>|</TT>. But not so for <TT>^</TT>.
<p>
One of the early bits of C evolution was the creation of separate
<TT>&amp;&amp;</TT> and <TT>||</TT> operators.  This was better than the special rule, which was hard
to explain.
<p>
In other words, the whole question arises because of the particular method
of symmetry-breaking that C chose.   Suppose I had reacted to
the situation of BCPL and B taking their notion of
<p>
<pre>
	if (a &amp; b) ...
</pre>
<p>
and had people say
<p>
<pre>
	if (a) andif (b) ...
</pre>
(and similarly with `<TT>orif</TT>').  One can make a case that this kind of syntax is
better than <TT>&amp;&amp;</TT> and <TT>||</TT>.  If it had happened, would people be asking for `<TT>xorif</TT>'?
Probably not.
<p>
My guess is that <TT>&amp;</TT>,<TT>&amp;&amp;</TT>; <TT>|</TT>,<TT>||</TT>; <TT>^</TT>,<TT>^^</TT> is a false symmetry.  But it's
one that people seem to want, and, though it's not much help,
adding it wouldn't do much harm.

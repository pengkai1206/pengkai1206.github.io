<!-- qtag -->Question 7.7
</h1>
<p>
<font face=Helvetica size=8 color=blue><b>Q:</b></font>
Why does some code carefully cast the values returned by <TT>malloc</TT>
to the pointer type being allocated?
</p><p><hr>
<p>
<font face=Helvetica size=8 color=blue><b>A:</b></font>

Before ANSI/ISO
Standard
C
introduced
the <TT>void&nbsp;*</TT> generic pointer type,
these casts were
typically
required
to silence

warnings
(and perhaps induce conversions)
when assigning
between incompatible pointer types.
</p><p>


Under ANSI/ISO Standard C,
these casts are
no longer necessary.

It can also be argued
that

they
are
now
to be discouraged;
see question <a href="mallocnocast.html">7.7b</a>.
Furthermore,
well-defined,
low-risk
implicit conversions
(such as those which C has always performed between

integer and floating-point types)
can be considered a

feature.

</p><p>On the other hand,



some programmers prefer to make <em>every</em> conversion explicit,
to record that they have considered each case
and decided exactly what should happen
(see also question <a href="../style/voidcasts.html">17.5</a>).
Also,
the casts are typically seen in C code
which
for one reason or another
is intended to be compatible with C++,

where explicit casts
from
<TT>void&nbsp;*</TT>
are required.
</p><p>(By the way, the language in sections 6.5 and 7.8.5 of
K&amp;R2
which suggests that the casts are required
is ``overenthusiastic.'')
</p><p>To some extent,
whether you use these casts or not is a matter of style;
see
section
<a href="../style/index.html">17</a>.

[I and correspondent were discussing, among other things, the
fact that pointer types aren't necessarily all identical
and that pointer casts might therefore involve actual conversions.
I drew Chris Torek into the conversation,
and the text below is excerpted from his contribution.]

Subject: Re: Q: How do you assign a float to a (void) data?
<p>
I just want to add one or two specifics to Steve's message...
<p>
&gt;Word-addressed machines are by no means hypothetical.  I can
<br>
&gt;never remember the details, but I believe that machines
<br>
&gt;manufactured by Data General, PR1ME, and/or Cray have used such
<br>
&gt;schemes, and C compilers have been written for these machines.
<br>
&gt;(Writing code for these machines, and especially porting existing
<br>
&gt;code to such machines, is a real lesson in portable pointer usage.)
<p>
I have never used a Cray, but I believe the list above is correct
(if not complete).  On the other hand, I have used the Data General
MV-series machines.  These have `word pointers' and `byte pointers',
where words are made up of two bytes.  (This seems odd at first,
as the machine has 32-bit integers, but is due to the history of
the machine; the pointer format is an extension of that used on
the DG Nova, a 16-bit word-addressed machine.  The Nova also had
only 8 ALU ops, including a subtract-with-borrow but no subtract-
without-borrow.  This was because they used a 74xx series ALU, that
had 16 ops, but had only 3 bits left in the instruction, so they
hardwired one of the ALU operand pins to a `1'.  The MV series
fixed <em>that</em> particular annoyance.)
<p>
On the DG, to convert a word pointer to a byte pointer, you shift
the word pointer left, introducing a 0 bit as the `byte offset'
bit.  The top bit of a word pointer is an `indirection' bit; this
is lost in the conversion.  Similarly, to convert a byte pointer
to a word pointer, you shift the byte pointer right, losing the
byte offset and introducing a 0 bit as the `indirection' bit.  Such
a shift also moves the segment and ring bits, and I can no longer
recall whether they were expected to be shifted this way, or whether
there was a special pair of shift instructions that preserved these
bits, moving only the address bits.

Here's another way that's not in the FAQ.  It does depend on the <TT>vfprintf</TT>
function being in your library and on a compiler that optimizes out
expressions that cannot be executed.  Most modern libraries and compilers
do have this.  Even if the optimization is absent, the trick will still
work although the executeable will have some dead code in it.
<p>
I start by defining the symbol "debug" according to the state of the
symbol "DEBUG" like so:   (this can be in your .h file)
<pre>
#ifdef DEBUG
#define debug                   _debug_call
#else
#define debug                   1?0:
#endif
</pre>
<p>
Then I define a function called "_debug_call()" which accepts one or more
fixed arguments followed by a variable number of arguments.  For example:
<pre>
        int _debug_call( int msglev, const char *msgfmt, ... )
</pre>
<p>
That function will need to include stdarg.h and have a variable defined:
<pre>
        va_list arg_list;
</pre>
<p>
Then following any code which does things like deciding whether the message
should even be printed (I have varying debug levels, for example), I have
<pre>
        va_start( arg_list, msgfmt );
        vfprintf( stderr, msgfmt , arg_list );
        putc( '\n', stderr );
</pre>
<p>
Now if the symbol DEBUG is not defined, then the symbol debug is define
with the string "1?0:".  When the pre-processor sees something like
<pre>
        debug( 1, "begin %s", argv[0] );
</pre>
It turns it into:
<pre>
        1?0:(1,"begin %s",argv[0]);
</pre>
which is now a <TT>?:</TT> expression which evaluates the left side of <TT>:</TT> but not
the right side.  The right side is merely a parenthesized expression
which, if it were evaluated, would discard all comma separated expressions
but the last, yielding the last.  But the <TT>?:</TT> causes it to not be evaluated
and a good compiler will recognize that since 1 is a constant, the right
side of <TT>:</TT> cannot ever be evaluated, and not even compile it it.  This it
becomes a free standing value.  If you did choose to assign <TT>debug()</TT> to
something line:
<pre>
        result = debug( 1, "begin %s", argv[0] );
</pre>
Then you get:
<pre>
        result = 1?0:(1,"begin %s",argv[0]);
</pre>
which has the effect of:
<pre>
        result = 0;
</pre>
Now if <TT>DEBUG</TT> is defined, then it becomes:
<pre>
        _debug_call(1,"begin %s",argv[0]);
</pre>
and voila, it is compiled as a function call.  You do have to place the
definition of "DEBUG" before the pre-processor code that decides how to
define "debug".  I do this by having the part the decides how to define
"debug" in a header file, called debug.h, and I simply define, or not,
the symbol "DEBUG" before including debug.h.
<p>
Above I have given a simple version.  My actual debug package is a bit
more complex, having features to manage debug levels, which files to
output to, and a separately named duplication called <TT>trace</TT> (the same
thing all over again, but with a new name which I can use for a different
group of concepts, and a separate messaging level state).
<p>
If anyone wants to include the above trick in an FAQ or publish it or
whatever, feel free to do so.

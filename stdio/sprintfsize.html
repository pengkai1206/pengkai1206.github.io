<p>
<font face=Helvetica size=8 color=blue><b>Q:</b></font>
How can I tell how much destination buffer space I'll need
for an arbitrary <TT>sprintf</TT> call?
How can I avoid
overflowing
the destination buffer with <TT>sprintf</TT>?
</p><p><hr>
<p>
<font face=Helvetica size=8 color=blue><b>A:</b></font>
When the format string being used with <TT>sprintf</TT> is
known and
relatively simple,
you can
sometimes
predict
a
buffer
size in an ad-hoc way.
If
the format
consists of one or two <TT>%s</TT>'s,
you can count the fixed
characters in the format
string yourself
(or let <TT>sizeof</TT> count them for you)
and add in the result of calling <TT>strlen</TT>
on the string(s) to be inserted.
For example,
to
compute the buffer size that the call
<pre>
	sprintf(buf, "You typed \"%s\"", answer);
</pre>
would need,
you could
write:
<pre>
	int bufsize = 13 + strlen(answer);
or
	int bufsize = sizeof("You typed \"%s\"") + strlen(answer);
</pre>

followed by
<pre>
	char *buf = malloc(bufsize);
	if(buf != NULL)
		sprintf(buf, "You typed \"%s\"", answer);
</pre>
You can
conservatively
estimate the size that <TT>%d</TT> will expand to with
code like:
<pre>
#include &lt;limits.h&gt;
char buf[(sizeof(int) * CHAR_BIT + 2) / 3 + 1 + 1];
sprintf(buf, "%d", n);
</pre>

This code
computes
the number of characters required
for a base-8 representation of a number;
a base-10 expansion is guaranteed to take as much room or less.
(The <TT>+2</TT> takes care of truncation if the size is not a
multiple of 3,
and 
the <TT>+1+1</TT> leaves room for a leading <TT>-</TT>
and a trailing <TT>\0</TT>.)
An
analogous technique
could of course be used for <TT>long&nbsp;int</TT>,
and the same buffer can obviously be used with
<TT>%u</TT>, <TT>%o</TT>, and <TT>%x</TT>
formats
as well.
</p><p>When the format string is more complicated,
or
is
not
even
known until run time,
predicting the buffer size becomes as
difficult
as reimplementing <TT>sprintf</TT>,
and correspondingly error-prone
(and inadvisable).
A
last-ditch
technique
which is sometimes
suggested
is to use
<TT>fprintf</TT> to print the same text to a
temporary file,
and
then to
look at <TT>fprintf</TT>'s return value

or
the size of the file
(but see question <a href="../osdep/filesize.html">19.12</a>).
(Using a temporary file for this application
is admittedly
clumsy and inelegant,<a href="diskerr.html" rel=subdocument>[footnote]</a>
but it's the only portable solution
besides writing an entire <TT>sprintf</TT> format 
interpreter.
If your system provides one,
you can

use
a null or ``bit bucket'' device
such as
<TT>/dev/null</TT> or <TT>NUL</TT>
instead of a temporary file.)
</p><p>If there's
any
chance that the buffer might not be big enough,
you won't want to call <TT>sprintf</TT>
without some guarantee
that the buffer will not overflow
and overwrite some other part of
memory.
If the format string is known,
you can limit <TT>%s</TT> expansion by using
<TT>%.</TT>N<TT>s</TT>
for some N,
or <TT>%.*s</TT>
(see also question <a href="printfvwid.html">12.10</a>).
</p><p>To avoid
the overflow problem,
you can use
a length-limited version of <TT>sprintf</TT>,
namely <TT>snprintf</TT>.
It
is
used like this:
<pre>
	snprintf(buf, bufsize, "You typed \"%s\"", answer);
</pre>
<TT>snprintf</TT>
has been available in several stdio libraries
(including GNU and 4.4bsd)
for several years.
It
has finally been
standardized in C99.
</p><p>As an extra, added bonus,
the C99 <TT>snprintf</TT> provides a way
to predict the size required
for an arbitrary <TT>sprintf</TT> call.
C99's
<TT>snprintf</TT> returns
the number of characters it would have placed in the buffer
if there were room,
not just how many it did place.
Furthermore,
it may be called with
a null pointer
and
a buffer size
of 0
and a null pointer as the destination buffer.
Therefore, the call
<pre>
	nch = snprintf(NULL, 0, fmtstring, /* other arguments */ );
</pre>
computes
the number of characters required
for the fully-formatted
string.
With that number
(<TT>nch</TT>)
in hand,
you can then malloc a big-enough buffer
and make a second <TT>snprintf</TT> call to fill it.
</p><p>Yet another option is





the (nonstandard) <TT>asprintf</TT> function,
present in various C libraries including bsd's and GNU's,
which formats to

(and returns a pointer to)
a <TT>malloc</TT>'ed buffer,
like this:
<pre>
char *buf;
asprintf(&amp;buf, "%d = %s", 42, "forty-two");
/* now buf points to malloc'ed space containing formatted string */
</pre>

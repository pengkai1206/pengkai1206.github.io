<font face=Helvetica size=8 color=blue><b>Q:</b></font>
What's wrong with casting <TT>malloc</TT>'s return value?
</p><p><hr>
<p>
<font face=Helvetica size=8 color=blue><b>A:</b></font>

Suppose that you
call <TT>malloc</TT>
but forget to <TT>#include &lt;stdlib.h&gt;</TT>.
The compiler is likely to assume that <TT>malloc</TT>
is a function returning <TT>int</TT>,
which is of course incorrect, and will lead to trouble.
Now, if
your call to <TT>malloc</TT> is of the form
<pre>
	char *p = malloc(10);
</pre>
the compiler will notice
that you're seemingly assigning an integer to a pointer,
and will likely emit a warning of the form
``assignment of pointer from integer lacks a cast''
(see question <a href="decl.html">7.6</a>),
which will alert you to the problem.
(The problem is of course that you forgot to <TT>#include &lt;stdlib.h&gt;</TT>,
not that you forgot to use a cast.)
If, on the other hand, your call to <TT>malloc</TT>
includes a cast:
<pre>
	char *p = (char *)malloc(10);
</pre>
the compiler is likely to assume that you know what you're doing,
that you really do want to convert the <TT>int</TT> returned by
<TT>malloc</TT> to a pointer, and the compiler
therefore probably <em>won't</em> warn you.
But of course <TT>malloc</TT> does not return an <TT>int</TT>,
so trying to convert the <TT>int</TT> that it doesn't return
to a pointer is likely to lead to a different kind of trouble,
which will be harder to track down.
</p><p>(Of course, compilers are increasingly likely--especially under C99--to
emit warnings whenever functions are called without prototypes in scope,
and such a warning would alert you to the lack of <TT>&lt;stdlib.h&gt;</TT>
whether casts were used or not.)

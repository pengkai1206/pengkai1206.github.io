<p>
<font face=Helvetica size=8 color=blue><b>Q:</b></font>
Is C++ a superset of C?
What are the differences between C and C++?
Can I use a C++ compiler to compile C code?
</p><p><hr>
<p>
<font face=Helvetica size=8 color=blue><b>A:</b></font>
C++ was derived from C,
and is largely based on it,
but there are some legal C constructs
which are not legal C++.
Conversely,
ANSI C inherited several features from C++,
including prototypes and <TT>const</TT>,
so neither language is really a subset or superset of the other;
the two also define the meaning of some common constructs differently.

</p><p>The most important feature of C++ not found in C is of course 
the extended structure
known as a <TT>class</TT>

which
along with operator overloading
makes object-oriented programming convenient.
There are
several
other differences and new features:
variables may be declared anywhere in a block;
<TT>const</TT> variables
may be true compile-time
constants;
structure tags are implicitly typedeffed;

an <TT>&amp;</TT> in a parameter declaration requests pass by reference;
and
the <TT>new</TT> and <TT>delete</TT> operators,
along with per-object constructors and destructors,
simplify dynamic data structure management.
There are
a host of
mechanisms tied up with 
classes and object-oriented programming:
inheritance,
<TT>friend</TT>s,
virtual functions,
templates,
etc.
(This list of C++ features is not intended to be complete;
C++ programmers will notice many omissions.)
</p><p>Some
features of C which keep it from being a strict subset of C++
(that is, which keep C programs from necessarily being 
acceptable to C++ compilers)
are that
<TT>main</TT>
may be called recursively,
character constants are of type <TT>int</TT>,
prototypes are not required,
and
<TT>void&nbsp;*</TT>
implicitly converts to other pointer types.

Also, every keyword in C++ which is not a keyword in C
is available in C as an identifier;
C programs which use words like <TT>class</TT> and <TT>friend</TT>
as ordinary identifiers will be rejected by C++ compilers.
</p><p>In spite of the differences,
many
C programs will
compile correctly in a C++ environment,
and many recent compilers
offer both C and C++ compilation modes.
(But it's usually a bad idea to compile straight C code as if it were C++;
the languages are different enough
that you'll generally get poor results.)

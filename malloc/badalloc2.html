[Someone asked me why after invoking
<pre>
	p = malloc(1);
</pre>
it was apparently possible to copy long strings --
much longer than 1 byte long --
to <TT>p</TT>.
This was my reply.]
<p>
There are several different answers here, depending on just what
it is you're trying to ask.
<p>
It sounds like you're aware of the reasons the program might not work.
You're right, it might not work, it can't be expected to work.
If, based on the fact that the program &ldquo;just happens&rdquo; to work,
you're tempted to conclude that those other reasons were wrong,
don't do this!  The program is definitely wrong.  But there's an
unfortunate paradox about software testing: if a program does not
work, it definitely has a bug of some sort, but if on the other
hand it seems to work, we can <em>not</em> conclude from this that it
has no bugs!
<p>
Another way of answering the question is this: You are walking
along a deserted street at 3:00 in the morning.  You come to an
intersection.  The light is red, and the sign says &ldquo;Don't Walk&rdquo;.
You decide to cross the street anyway, even though this is
Illegal and Wrong.  As you cross the street, you are not hit by
a car, and no policeman arrests you -- you reach the other side
unscathed.  Why?
<p>
Or, as Roger Miller has written, &ldquo;Somebody told me that in
basketball you can't hold the ball and run.  I got a basketball
and tried it and it worked just fine.  He obviously didn't
understand basketball.&rdquo;
<p>
If you want to understand at a low level how the program could
work, in spite of its egregious error, the explanation is
actually not too far from the traffic light parable above.
You asked <TT>malloc</TT> for a pointer to 1 byte of memory.  <TT>malloc</TT> gave
you such a pointer, but your computer certainly has more than 1
byte of memory available, so the pointer <TT>malloc</TT> gives you points
somewhere in the middle of all the memory your program has
available to it.  You're only <em>supposed</em> to write 1 byte to the
memory <TT>malloc</TT> &ldquo;gave&rdquo; you, because that's all you asked for, but
there's memory sitting there beyond the 1 byte you asked for, and
there's no mechanism, no policeman which will immediately notice
and complain if you write more than you should.
<p>
(Perhaps a better analogy is this.  Your mother and father run a
general store.  One day you ask your mother for a dollar.  Your
mother trusts you, so she says you can go to the cash register at
the front of the store and take a dollar out of it.  You open the
drawer of the cash register, and there's $500 in there.  What
happens if you take more, much more, then the single dollar you
were entrusted to take?  You might get caught eventually, but you
probably won't get caught right away.)
<p>
If you want to convince yourself that writing more to a malloc'ed
region than you're supposed to is wrong, if you want to see the
kind of errors that typically arise if you do, you'll need a
program that tries to do a bit more, after it makes its mistake,
so that you and/or the computer and/or the malloc library will
have a chance to notice that things are going wrong.  For
example, you can malloc two pointers, and notice that when you
overflow one of them, the second string is (probably) affected:
<p>
<pre>
	#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;
	#include &lt;stdlib.h&gt;
	#include &lt;string.h&gt;

	int main()
	{
		char *p1 = malloc(1);
		char *p2 = malloc(20);

		strcpy(p2, "Hello, world!");

		printf("p2 = \"%s\"\n", p2);

		strcpy(p1, "This is more than I should write to one byte");

		printf("p1 = \"%s\"\n", p1);
		printf("p2 = \"%s\"\n", p2);

		return 0;
	}
</pre>
<p>
Or, you can copy some huge number of characters:
<p>
<pre>
	#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;
	#include &lt;stdlib.h&gt;
	#include &lt;string.h&gt;

	int main()
	{
		char *p1 = malloc(1);
		char *p2 = malloc(1);

		memcpy(p1, p2, 1000000);

		return 0;
	}
</pre>
<p>
I have tested both of these programs on my computer, and they
fail as expected (though I can't promise they'll fail, or in the
same way, for you).
<p>
Another way to notice when things are going wrong with malloc'ed
memory is to <em>always</em> check the return value from <TT>malloc</TT>.
It's tempting not to check the return value, especially when
you're allocating a small amount of memory, and in fact
I myself succumbed to the temptation in the two programs above.
After all, as we just pointed out, our computer certainly has
more than one byte of memory in it, so a call to <TT>malloc(1)</TT> can
&ldquo;never&rdquo; fail, right?  Well, no, actually it can.  <TT>malloc</TT> will
typically
also return NULL if it notices that you've written more than you
were supposed to to one of the pointers it previously gave you.
So you should <em>always</em> check malloc's return value.  (And,
anyway, some day you might actually run out of memory.)
So here is one more test program:
<p>
<pre>
	#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;
	#include &lt;stdlib.h&gt;
	#include &lt;string.h&gt;

	int main()
	{
		char *p1, *p2;

		p1 = malloc(1);
		if(p1 == NULL)
			{
			fprintf(stderr, "malloc failed\n");
			exit(EXIT_FAILURE);
			}

		strcpy(p1, "This is more than I should write to one byte");

		printf("p1 = \"%s\"\n", p1);

		p2 = malloc(1);
		if(p2 == NULL)
			{
			fprintf(stderr, "second malloc failed\n");
			exit(EXIT_FAILURE);
			}

		printf("p1 = \"%s\"\n", p1);

		*p2 = 'X';

		printf("p1 = \"%s\"\n", p1);

		return EXIT_SUCCESS;
	}
</pre>
<p>
I expected that the second call to <TT>malloc</TT> would fail, due to the
fact that I copied more text to <TT>p1</TT> than I was supposed to.  For
some reason, on my computer, the second call to malloc actually
succeeded, but there's a good chance it will fail on yours.

A major revision and expansion of the comp.lang.c FAQ list
was published in late 1995 by Addison-Wesley,
to wit:
<pre>
	Author: Steve Summit
	Title: C Programming FAQs: Frequently Asked Questions
	Publisher: Addison-Wesley
	Copyright: 1996
	ISBN: 0-201-84519-9
</pre>
Most technical bookstores,
as well as several of the large chains,
are carrying this book.
If you can't find it,
you can order it
(in the U.S., at least)
directly from Addison-Wesley by calling 800-282-0693.
I'm sure you could also order it on-line from
<a href="http://www.amazon.com/">Amazon.com</a>
or other on-line booksellers.
<p>
Addison-Wesley has web pages describing
<a href="http://www.awl.com/cseng/titles/0-201-84519-9">this book</a>
as well as
<a href="http://www.aw.com/cseng/">many others</a>.
You can also browse the content corresponding to the
<a href="http://www.eskimo.com/~scs/C-faq/top.html">on-line version</a>
of the FAQ list
(but note that this corresponds to only about half of the actual book!).
<p>
It's said that imitation is the sincerest form of flattery,
but I find it far more flattering that
Kinichi Kitano and Przemyslaw Kowalczyk
have managed to translate this book,
into
Japanese and Polish,
respectively.
(That's what the second and third cover pictures at the top of the page are.)
<p>
As the Preface mentions,
``it can be as hard to eradicate the last error from a large 
manuscript as it is to stamp out the last bug in a program.''
If you've already obtained a copy of the book,
you'll want to skim this
<a href="Errata.html">errata list</a>.
<p>
I'd like to publicly thank Addison-Wesley for their support of the FAQ list,
for giving me the opportunity to put it out in book form,
and for being <em>very</em> easy to work with.
All first-time authors should have it so lucky.

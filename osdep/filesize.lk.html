&gt; ...But you're right, SEEK_END is still a kicker.
<p>
Assuming that it is a real problem (like whether the possibility of
UCHAR_MAX &gt; INT_MAX is a real problem). My guess would be that any
platform that is capable of determining a precise file size will
get SEEK_END right on a binary stream. If you're worried state the
assumption in the program documentation but don't lose sleep
over it.
<p>
There are still good reasons not to get a file size e.g.
<ol>
<p><li>
the file may not be seekable or even have a size (e.g. input from
console/serial port/tty/pipe/socket).
<p><li>
the file size may change between determining it and making use of it.
</ol>
<p>
If however you really do need to find the size of a file (you know to
be a regular file) without actually scanning it end to end there is
no more portable way than to use fseek/SEEK_END/ftell on a binary stream.

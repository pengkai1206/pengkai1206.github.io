<font face=Helvetica size=8 color=blue><b>Q:</b></font>
Once I've used <TT>freopen</TT>, how can I get the original
<TT>stdout</TT>
(or <TT>stdin</TT>)
back?
</p><p><hr>

There isn't a good way.
If you need to switch back,
the
best solution
is not to
have used
<TT>freopen</TT> in the
first place.
Try using your own explicit output (or input) stream variable,
which you can reassign at will, while leaving the original
<TT>stdout</TT> (or <TT>stdin</TT>) undisturbed.
For example, declare a global
<pre>
	FILE *ofp;
</pre>
and replace all calls to <TT>printf( </TT>...<TT> )</TT> with
<TT>fprintf(ofp, </TT>...<TT> )</TT>.
(Obviously, you'll have to check for calls to
<TT>putchar</TT> and <TT>puts</TT>, too.)
Then you can set <TT>ofp</TT> to <TT>stdout</TT>
or
to anything else.
</p><p>You might wonder if you could skip <TT>freopen</TT> entirely,
and do something like
<pre>
	FILE *savestdout = stdout;
	stdout = fopen(file, "w");	/* WRONG */
</pre>
leaving yourself able to restore <TT>stdout</TT> later by doing
<pre>
	stdout = savestdout;		/* WRONG */
</pre>
but code like this is not likely to work,


because <TT>stdout</TT>
(and <TT>stdin</TT> and <TT>stderr</TT>)
are

typically constants which cannot be reassigned

(which
is why <TT>freopen</TT> exists in the first place).
</p><p>It may be possible,
in a nonportable way,
to save away
information about a stream
before
calling <TT>freopen</TT>
to open some file in its place,
such that the original stream can later be restored.
The most straightforward and reliable way is to manipulate the
underlying file descriptors using 
a system-specific call such as
<TT>dup</TT>
or
<TT>dup2</TT>,
if available (<a href="rd.kirby.c">example</a>).
Another is to
copy or inspect the contents of the
<TT>FILE</TT>
structure,
but this is exceedingly
nonportable
and unreliable.
</p><p>Under some systems,
you might be able to reopen a special device file
(such as <TT>/dev/fd/1</TT> under modern versions of Unix)
which is still attached to (for example) the original standard output.
You can,
under some systems,
explicitly re-open the controlling terminal
(see question <a href="devtty.html">12.36</a>),
but this isn't necessarily what you want,
since the
original
input or output
(i.e. what <TT>stdin</TT> or <TT>stdout</TT> had been
before you called <TT>freopen</TT>)
could have been redirected
from the command line.
</p><p>All of this pertains to stdio redirection
initially performed by <TT>freopen</TT>,
affecting the I/O calls
within the same program that called <TT>freopen</TT>.
If what you're trying to do is capture the result of a 
subprogram


execution,
<TT>freopen</TT> probably won't work
anyway;
see question <a href="../osdep/popen.html">19.30</a> instead.

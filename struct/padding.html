<p>
<font face=Helvetica size=8 color=blue><b>Q:</b></font>
Why is my
compiler
leaving holes in structures,
wasting space
and preventing

``binary'' I/O to external data
files?
Can
I turn
this
off,
or otherwise control the alignment of structure fields?

</p><p><hr>
<p>
<font face=Helvetica size=8 color=blue><b>A:</b></font>
Many machines
access values in memory
most efficiently
when the values are appropriately aligned.
(For example,
on a byte-addressed machine,
<TT>short&nbsp;int</TT>s of size 2
might best be placed at even addresses,
and
<TT>long&nbsp;int</TT>s of size 4
at addresses which are a multiple of 4.)
Some machines cannot perform unaligned accesses
at all,
and
<em>require</em> that
all data
be appropriately aligned.
</p><p>Therefore, if you declare a structure like
<pre>
	struct {
		char c;
		int i;
	};
</pre>
the compiler will usually
leave an unnamed, unused hole
between the <TT>char</TT> and <TT>int</TT> fields,
to ensure that the

<TT>int</TT> field
is properly aligned.
(This incremental alignment of the second field
based on the first
relies on the fact
that the structure itself
is always properly aligned,
with the most conservative

alignment requirement.
The compiler guarantees this alignment for structures it allocates,
as does <TT>malloc</TT>.)
</p><p>Your compiler may provide an extension to give you
control
over the packing of structures
(i.e. whether they are padded or not),
perhaps
with
a <TT>#pragma</TT> (see
question <a href="../ansi/pragma.html">11.20</a>),
but there
is no standard method.
</p><p>If you're worried about wasted space,
you can minimize the effects of padding
by ordering the members of
a
structure


based on their base types,
from largest to smallest.

You can sometimes get more control over size and alignment
by using bit-fields,
although they
have their own drawbacks.
(See question <a href="bitfields.html">2.26</a>.)

I posted the following on 14 Feb 1998 summarising the cases noted in H&amp;S.
Apologies for the somewhat assertive phrasing -- it was appropriate in

In C++, you can't use the identifiers asm, bool, catch, class, const_cast,
delete, dynamic_cast, false, friend, inline, mutable, namespace, new,
operator, private, protected, public, reinterpret_cast, static_cast,
template, this, throw, true, try, typeid, using, or virtual.  You can't
declare a type inside a struct definition and have it visible outside.
You can't have storage class specifiers in type declarations.  You
can't refer to a top-level 'const' object with no explicit storage
class from another translation unit.  You can't initialise a character
array from a string literal which is "too long".  You can't call a
function without declaring it first.  You can't use old-style function
definitions.  You can't use enumeration constants as integers (without
an explicit cast).  You can't convert from a '<TT>void&nbsp;*</TT>' to another pointer
type without an explicit cast.  You can't declare types inside sizeof
expressions, parameter lists or return types.  You can't jump into a
compound statement if this would skip declarations with initialisers.
You can't do a 'return' with no value from a non-void function, even
if you never use the "result".  You can't call 'main' recursively.
<p>
Also, you may get different behaviour in C++ because: // comments are
recognised; structure tags are implicitly declared as typedef names;
a declaration like 'int f()' is a prototype declaration and signifies
that the function takes no arguments.

If by "different semantics" you mean a program which is valid C and valid
C++ but has a different meaning under each, the examples of this tend to be
a bit improbable.  The one which always surfaces on occasions such as these
is
<p>
<pre>
  int x = 2 //* Would anyone actually write this? */ 2
    ;
</pre>
<p>
which sets x to 2 in C++ (because everything after the // disappears) or 1
in C (because only the /*...*/ goes).
<p>
Another one is:
<p>
<pre>
  typedef int x;
  {
    struct x { int a, b; };
    printf ("%d\n", (int) sizeof (x));
  }
</pre>
<p>
This prints sizeof(int) in C.  In C++, the struct tag 'x' shadows the outer
typedef so the size of the structure -- at least 2*sizeof(int) -- is
displayed.

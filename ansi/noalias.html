<p>
<font face=Helvetica size=8 color=blue><b>Q:</b></font>
What was <TT>noalias</TT> and what ever happened to it?
</p><p><hr>
<p>
<font face=Helvetica size=8 color=blue><b>A:</b></font>
<TT>noalias</TT> was another type qualifier,
in the same syntactic class as <TT>const</TT> and <TT>volatile</TT>,
which was intended to assert that
an
object
was not
pointed to (``aliased'') by other pointers.
The primary application,
which is an important one,
would have been for the formal parameters of functions
designed to perform computations on large arrays.
A compiler cannot usually take advantage of vectorization
or other parallelization
hardware
(on supercomputers which have it)
unless it can ensure
that the source and destination arrays do not overlap.
</p><p>The <TT>noalias</TT> keyword was not backed up by any ``prior art,''
and it was introduced late in the review and approval process.
It was
surprisingly
difficult to define precisely and explain coherently,
and sparked widespread, acrimonious debate,
including a scathing pan by Dennis Ritchie.
It had far-ranging implications,
particularly for several standard library interfaces,
for which easy fixes were not readily apparent.
</p><p>Because of the criticism and the difficulty of defining
<TT>noalias</TT> well,
the Committee

declined to adopt it,
in spite of its superficial

attractions.
(When writing a standard,
features cannot be introduced halfway;
their full integration,
and all implications,
must be understood.)
The need for an explicit mechanism
to support parallel implementation of
non-overlapping operations remains

unfilled
(although
some work is being done
on
the problem).

&gt; I am writing a library, of which a function should return a string:
<br>
&gt; But the [routine tends to return] ... (rubbish).
<br>
&gt; Is this because test is a local valuable?
<br>
&gt;      I know I can use static char or declare test as global,
<br>
&gt; but the first method would make the code not so understand,
<br>
&gt; while the second would not be possible in a library.
<p>
I'm not sure why using static would make the code harder to
understand; it's one of the popular and recommended solutions.
<p>
I know of at least nine different ways of returning aggregates
(i.e. structures and arrays, including strings) from subroutines
in C, although one of them doesn't work, two of them are
combinations, and one of them is a joke.
<ol>
<p><li>
local: the routine returns a pointer to a local array or
structure.  This is the one that doesn't work.
<p><li>
caller-supplied: the caller passes a pointer to the
return buffer, and its size.
<p><li>
malloc: the routine returns a pointer, obtained from
<TT>malloc</TT>, to a dynamically-allocated region of memory; the
caller is responsible for explicitly freeing it (perhaps
with a special <TT>xxxfree()</TT> routine which you also supply,
if the returned structure contains other pointers which
must also be freed).
<p><li>
static: the routine returns a pointer to the proverbial
``static buffer whose content is overwritten by each call.''
(An additional wrinkle is that several routines may share
a single static buffer, &agrave; la <TT>ctime</TT> and <TT>asctime</TT>).
<p><li>
a combination of 2 and 3: if the caller passes a null
pointer, the routine returns a dynamically-allocated
pointer.
<p><li>
a combination of 2 and 4: if the caller passes a null
pointer, the routine returns a pointer to static data.
<p><li>
struct: as long as the return data can be encapsulated in
a single struct, the entire struct can be returned (with
a conventional, by-value <TT>return</TT> statement) and the
compiler essentially worries about allocation.  (This
technique does not work well for strings, though,
especially if they are to be arbitrarily long.)
<p><li>
multiple static: a generalization of 4; the routine
returns a pointer to one of several static buffers.
This means that the caller may use a small number of
return values simultaneously, and does not have to worry
about freeing them.
<p><li>
temporary file: the routine writes the data to a
temporary file which the caller opens and reads.
(Of course, if the routine picks the temporary file name,
there is then the problem of retuning that name to the
caller...)
</ol>
<p>
I have heard that number 5 is a favorite of the GNU project.
I like number 8 a lot, although I don't end up using it all that
often.
<p>
Numbers 2 and 3 are obviously the simplest safe options,
although they are more work for the caller.  Between the two,
number 2 is fine most of the time; number 3 is appropriate when
the caller has no good way of estimating the required size of the
return buffer (and the data must all be returned at once), or
when the caller is quite likely to call malloc and store a copy
of several return values anyway, and when the overhead and other
mild disadvantages of dynamic memory allocation will not be a
problem.
<p>
Number 4, though it can be annoying and error-prone, is fine in
certain circumstances, obviously those in which it is unlikely
that the caller will have to be using several return values
simultaneously.  <TT>ctime()</TT> is a good example -- its most common use
is printing the current time of day, and since at any given
instant there is only one current time of day, the caller is not
likely to need to maintain multiple separate return values.
<p>
Numbers 5 and 6 obviously try to have their cake and eat it too,
which is sometimes appropriate, but which could lead to
unnecessary complexity and confusion (i.e. unsophisticated
programmers might be bewildered by the discussion in a routine's
documentation of its multiple personalities).  These techniques
should probably be used sparingly, only when extreme flexibility
will be truly be needed and when mostly experienced programmers
will be using the routine.
<p>
Number 7 is a perfectly adequate solution which is not as widely
known and used as it could be, due to the fact that many people
think of structures as ``second class citizens'' in C, because
according to K&amp;R1 they were, even though Ritchie's C compiler at
the time K&amp;R1 was published, and all quality C compilers since,
and all ANSI C compilers, fully support struct assignment,
passing, and return.
<p>
Note that if we have:
<p>
<pre>
	extern struct blort blortfunc();
	f()
	{
	struct blort blort1, blort2;

	blort1 = blortfunc(1);
	blort2 = blortfunc(2);

	...
	}
</pre>
<p>
, the struct return and assignment to two local struct variables
have allowed us to manipulate two simultaneous aggregate return
values, without collisions (i.e. without any ``data overwritten
with each call''), and without any manual allocation or
deallocation.
<p>
Number 8 is a little-known technique, which I invented myself one
day, although I've seen it mentioned once or twice on the net, so
other people have obviously thought of it, too.  This is another
mildly-sophisticated technique, use of which in the presence of
novice programmers might be confusing, but which can be extremely
useful given the right set of circumstances.  I only use it for
things like string formatting routines, which produce printable
string representations of other data structures, and which are
quite likely to be used more than once during a single call to,
say, <TT>printf</TT>.  For example, suppose I have
<p>
<pre>
	char *roman(int);
</pre>
which returns a roman-numeral representation of an <TT>int</TT>.  I might
want to do things like
<p>
<pre>
	printf("%s + %s = %s\n", roman(12), roman(34), roman(12 + 34));
</pre>
Now, if I were using technique 2, this would look like
<p>
<pre>
	char buf1[20], buf2[20], buf3[20];
	printf("%s + %s = %s\n", roman(12, buf1, 20), roman(34, buf2, 20),
						roman(12 + 34, buf3, 20));
</pre>
<p>
, which is a mess.  And if I were using technique 3, it would
look like
<p>
<pre>
	char *p1, *p2, *p3;
	printf("%s + %s = %s\n", p1 = roman(12), p2 = roman(34),
						p3 = roman(12 + 34));
	free(p1);
	free(p2);
	free(p3);
</pre>
<p>
, which is also a mess.
<p>
This is obviously exactly the sort of thing that technique 4
breaks down on, although of course you can do things like
<p>
<pre>
	printf("%s + ", roman(12));
	printf("%s = ", roman(34));
	printf("%s\n", roman(12 + 34));
</pre>
<p>
But if I'm using technique 8, and if <TT>roman()</TT>'s implementation
guarantees at least 3 separate static return buffers, then I can
in fact write the obvious
<p>
<pre>
	printf("%s + %s = %s\n", roman(12), roman(34), roman(12 + 34));
</pre>
and it will work just fine.
<p>
Technique 8's implementation looks something like
<p>
<pre>
	#define NRETBUFS 3
	#define RETBUFSIZE 20

	char *roman(n)
	int n;
	{
	static char retbufs[NRETBUFS][RETBUFSIZE];
	static int whichret = 0;
	char *ret;

	ret = retbufs[whichret];
	whichret = (whichret + 1) % NRETBUFS;

	now format answer into ret...

	return ret;
	}
</pre>
<p>
I won't say anything more about technique 9.

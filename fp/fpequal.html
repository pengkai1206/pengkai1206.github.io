<p>
<font face=Helvetica size=8 color=blue><b>Q:</b></font>
What's a good way to check for ``close enough''
floating-point equality?
</p><p><hr>
<p>
<font face=Helvetica size=8 color=blue><b>A:</b></font>
Since the absolute accuracy of floating point values varies,
by definition,
with their magnitude,

the
best way
of comparing two floating point values
is to use an accuracy threshold
which is relative
to the magnitude of the numbers being compared.
Rather than

<pre>
	double a, b;
	...
	if(a == b)	/* WRONG */
</pre>
use something like

<pre>
	#include &lt;math.h&gt;

	if(fabs(a - b) &lt;= epsilon * fabs(a))
</pre>
where
<TT>epsilon</TT>
is a value chosen to set the
degree of ``closeness''
(and where you know that <TT>a</TT> will not be zero).
The precise value of <TT>epsilon</TT> may still have to be chosen with
care:
its appropriate value may be quite small and related only to the
machine's floating-point
precision,
or

it may be larger
if the numbers being compared
are inherently less accurate
or are the results of
a chain of calculations
which
compounds

accuracy losses
over several steps.
(Also,
you may have to make the threshold
a function of <TT>b</TT>,
or of both <TT>a</TT> and <TT>b</TT>.)
</p><p>A decidedly inferior approach,
not generally recommended,
would be to use an absolute threshold:
<pre>
	if(fabs(a - b) &lt; 0.001)		/* POOR */
</pre>
Absolute
``fuzz factors''
like
0.001
never seem to work
for very long,
however.
As the numbers
being compared
change,
it's likely that two
small
numbers
that should be taken as different
happen to be within 0.001 of each other,
or that two large numbers,
which should have been treated as equal,
differ by more than 0.001 .
(And,

of course,
the problems merely shift around,
and do not go away,
when the fuzz factor is tweaked to 0.005,
or 0.0001,
or any other absolute number.)
</p><p>


Doug Gwyn suggests
using
the
following
``relative difference''
function.
It
returns the relative difference of two real numbers:
0.0 if they are exactly the same,
otherwise the ratio of the difference to the larger of the two.
<pre>
#define Abs(x)    ((x) &lt; 0 ? -(x) : (x))
#define Max(a, b) ((a) &gt; (b) ? (a) : (b))

double RelDif(double a, double b)
{
	double c = Abs(a);
	double d = Abs(b);

	d = Max(c, d);

	return d == 0.0 ? 0.0 : Abs(a - b) / d;
}
</pre>
Typical usage is
<pre>
	if(RelDif(a, b) &lt;= TOLERANCE) ...
</pre>

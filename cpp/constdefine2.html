[Someone asked about the difference between <TT>const</TT> and <TT>#define</TT> --
whether they &ldquo;used up&rdquo; memory, and which was &ldquo;safer&rdquo;.
This was my reply.]
<p>
It's true that <TT>#define</TT> doesn't &ldquo;use any memory&rdquo;.
But beyond that,
both
<TT>const</TT> and <TT>#define</TT> both have their safe and unsafe aspects.
<p>
As you noted, <TT>const</TT> &ldquo;takes up memory and has a benefit of type checking.&rdquo;
<p>
There are several other differences:
<p>
<TT>#define</TT> operates purely at compile time.  Actually, since it's a
preprocessor directive, you can think of it as operating <em>before</em>
the main part of the compiler actually starts compiling your code.
When you write
<p>
<pre>
	#define NUM1 45
	int array[NUM1];
</pre>
<p>
by the time the main part of the compiler actually starts
compiling your code, what it sees is just
<p>
<pre>
	int array[45];
</pre>
This example also illustrates one of the mildly &ldquo;unsafe&rdquo; aspects
of <TT>#define</TT>.  if you accidentally write
<p>
<pre>
	#define NUM1 45;
	int array[NUM1];
</pre>
<p>
what the compiler actually sees is then
<p>
<pre>
	int array[45;];
</pre>
which is a syntax error.
<p>
When you write
<p>
<pre>
	const int num2 = 45;
</pre>
on the other hand, the main part of the compiler allocates a
variable, of type <TT>int</TT>, and initializes it with the value 45,
and makes a note to itself that it should complain if you ever
try to modify this variable anywhere else in the source file.
<p>
The variable <TT>num2</TT> will, yes, exist in memory.  This means that
you can create a pointer pointing at <TT>num2</TT>, and sometimes, this
is important.
<p>
Normally we don't worry about the fact that <TT>const</TT> variables
&ldquo;eat up&rdquo; memory while <TT>#define</TT>s do not.  Typically we're only
talking about a few or a few dozen variables, which aren't going
to consume vast amounts of memory in any case.
<p>
The only critical disadvantage of <TT>const</TT> variables in C is that
you cannot use them in cases where you need a true compile-time
constant.  You cannot say
<p>
<pre>
	int array2[num2];
</pre>
or
<p>
<pre>
	switch(var)
		{
		case num2:
</pre>
<p>
You cannot declare a static or global variable and initialize it
with the value of num2.
<p>
To summarize, then, we have:
<p>
<TT>#define</TT>:
<p>
<ul>
<li>
operates at compile time
<li>
consumes no memory (though this is not too important)
<li>
can use in compile-time constant expression
<li>
uses different syntax; can make mistake with ;
<li>
can't create pointers to
<li>
no type checking
</ul>
<p>
<TT>const</TT>:
<p>
<ul>
<li>
operates at run time
<li>
consumes memory (though this is not too important)
<li>
can't use in compile-time constant expression
<li>
uses consistent syntax
<li>
can create pointers to
<li>
does type checking
</ul>
<p>
There might be one or two other differences that I'm forgetting.
<p>
It's also worth noting that <TT>const</TT> behaves differently in C versus C++.
In C++, <TT>const</TT> variables <em>can</em> be used in compile-time constant
expressions, and (as I understand it) they don't occupy space at
run time if they don't need to.

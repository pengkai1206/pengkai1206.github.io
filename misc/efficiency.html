What's the best way of making my program efficient?
</p><p><hr>
<p>
<font face=Helvetica size=8 color=blue><b>A:</b></font>
By picking good algorithms,
implementing them carefully,
and making sure that your program isn't doing any extra work.
For example,
the most microoptimized character-copying loop in the world
will be beat by code which avoids having to copy characters at all.
</p><p>When worrying about efficiency,
it's important to keep several things in perspective.
First of all,
although efficiency is
an enormously popular
topic,
it
is not
always as important
as people tend to think it is.
Most of the code in most programs is not time-critical.
When code is not time-critical,
it is
usually
more important that it be written clearly and portably
than that it be written maximally efficiently.
(Remember that
computers are very, very fast,
and that seemingly ``inefficient'' code
may be quite efficiently compilable,
and
run without apparent delay.)
</p><p>It is notoriously difficult to predict
what
the ``hot spots'' in a program will be.
When efficiency is a concern,
it is important to use profiling software
to determine which parts of the program deserve attention.
Often, actual computation time is swamped by peripheral tasks
such as I/O and memory allocation,
which can be sped up by using buffering and caching
techniques.
</p><p>Even
for
code that <em>is</em> time-critical,
one of the least effective optimization techniques
is to fuss with
the coding details.
Many of the ``efficient coding tricks''
which are frequently suggested
are performed automatically
by even
simpleminded
compilers.
Heavyhanded optimization attempts can make code so
bulky that performance is actually degraded,
by increasing the number of page faults or
by
overflowing 
instruction caches or pipelines.
Furthermore,
optimization tricks
are rarely portable
(i.e. they may speed things up on one machine
but slow them down on another).
In any case,
tweaking the coding usually results in
at best linear performance improvements;
the big payoffs are in better
algorithms.
</p><p>If the performance of your code is so important
that you are willing to invest programming time
in source-level optimizations,
make sure that you are using
the best optimizing compiler
you can afford.
(Compilers,
even mediocre ones,
can perform optimizations
that are impossible at the source level).
</p><p>When efficiency is truly
important,
the best algorithm has been chosen,
and even the coding details matter,
the following suggestions may be useful.
(These are mentioned merely
to keep followups down;
appearance here does
<em>not</em>
necessarily
constitute endorsement by the author.
Note that several of these techniques
cut both ways,
and
may make things worse.)
<OL><li>Sprinkle the code liberally with <TT>register</TT> declarations for
oft-used variables;
place them in inner blocks,
if applicable.
(On the other hand, most modern compilers ignore <TT>register</TT>
declarations, on the assumption that they can perform register 
analysis and assignment better than the programmer can.)
<li>Check the algorithm carefully.
Exploit symmetries where possible to reduce the number of explicit cases.
<li>Examine the control flow:
make sure that common cases are checked for first,
and handled more easily.
If one side of
an expression involving <TT>&amp;&amp;</TT> or <TT>||</TT>
will usually determine the outcome,

make it the left-hand side,
if possible.
(See also question <a href="../expr/shortcircuit.html">3.6</a>.)
<li>Use <TT>memcpy</TT> instead of
<TT>memmove</TT>,
if appropriate
(see question
<a href="../ansi/memmove.html">11.25</a>).
<li>Use machine- and vendor-specific routines and <TT>#pragma</TT>s.
<li>Manually place
common subexpressions
in temporary variables.
(Good compilers do this for you.)
<li>Move critical, inner-loop code
out of functions
and into macros or in-line functions
(and out of the loop, if invariant).
If the termination condition of a loop is a complex
but loop-invariant
expression,
precompute it and place it in a temporary variable.
(Good compilers do these for you.)
<li>


Change recursion to iteration, if possible.
<li>Unroll small loops.

<li>Discover whether
<TT>while</TT>, <TT>for</TT>,
or <TT>do/while</TT>
loops produce the best code under your compiler,
and whether incrementing or decrementing
the loop control variable
works best.
<li>Remove <TT>goto</TT> statements--some compilers can't optimize 
as well in their presence.
<li>Use pointers rather than array subscripts to step through arrays
(but see question <a href="eff2.html">20.14</a>).
<li>Reduce precision.
(Using <TT>float</TT> instead of <TT>double</TT>
may result in faster,
single-precision arithmetic under an ANSI compiler,
though
older compilers convert everything to <TT>double</TT>,
so using <TT>float</TT> can also be slower.)
Replace time-consuming trigonometric and logarithmic functions
with your own,
tailored to the range and precision you need,
and perhaps using table lookup.
(Be sure to give your versions
<em>different</em>
names;
see question <a href="../decl/namespace.html">1.29</a>.)
<li>Cache or precompute
tables of frequently-needed values.
(See also question <a href="bitcount.html">20.12</a>.)
<li>


Use standard library functions in preference to your own.
(Sometimes the compiler
inlines or
specially optimizes
its own functions.)
On the other hand,
if your program's calling patterns are
particularly regular,
your own special-purpose implementation may be able to beat
the library's general-purpose version.
(Again, if you do write your own version,
give it a different name.)
<li>As a last,
<em>last</em>
resort, hand-code critical routines in assembly language
(or hand-tune the compiler's assembly language output).
Use <TT>asm</TT> directives, if possible.
</OL></p><p>Here are some things <em>not</em> to worry about:
<OL><li>17x.
whether <TT>i++</TT> is faster than <TT>i&nbsp;=&nbsp;i&nbsp;+&nbsp;1</TT>
<li>18x.
whether <TT>i&nbsp;&lt;&lt;&nbsp;1</TT>
(or <TT>i&nbsp;&gt;&gt;&nbsp;1</TT>, or <TT>i&nbsp;&amp;&nbsp;1</TT>)
is faster than <TT>i&nbsp;*&nbsp;2</TT>
(respectively <TT>i&nbsp;/&nbsp;2</TT>, <TT>i&nbsp;%&nbsp;2</TT>).
</OL></p><p>(These are examples of optimizations which compilers regularly 
perform for you;
see questions <a href="eff2.html">20.14</a>
and <a href="shifts.html">20.15</a>.)
</p><p>It is not the intent here to suggest that efficiency can be
completely ignored.
Most of the time,
however,
by simply paying attention to good algorithm choices,
implementing them
cleanly,
and avoiding obviously inefficient blunders
(i.e. make sure you don't end up with an
O(n**3)
implementation of an
O(n**2)
algorithm),

perfectly acceptable results can be achieved.

as well as good advice on how to improve efficiency when it is important,

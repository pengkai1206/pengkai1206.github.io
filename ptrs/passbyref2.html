[This is a mail message I sent to someone who was wondering how,
if C uses ``pass by value'',
a function could modify a caller's passed array.]

&gt; I realize that only the values of the variables are passed to the function
<br>
&gt; on a stack, which makes it impossible for the calling function to alter
<br>
&gt; the values in the main function. Thus why is it possible for strcat() to
<br>
&gt; alter a string value in the main function, from the strcat function. 
<p>
There are two ways of looking at this.
<p>
The simplified way (which is also ever-so-slightly incorrect) is
to say that arrays are an exception to the rule that function
arguments are passed by value.  You can say that strcat() accepts
two arrays, and that arrays are passed by reference, in which case
the function <em>can</em> modify the contents of the array back up there
in the caller.
<p>
The completely correct way to explain it (which is also somewhat
confusing at first) is to say that arrays are never passed to
functions at all.  Instead, a pointer to the array's first
element is passed.  (In fact, you will usually see strcat()
documented as accepting two pointers to char.)  The function
receives a copy of the pointer, as usual, so it cannot modify the
pointer up in the caller.  <em>But</em>, the copied pointer it receives
obviously points to the same place (in this case, to the same
array containing the same string) as the original, so the
function <em>can</em> modify the memory (i.e. the string) pointed to by
the pointer.

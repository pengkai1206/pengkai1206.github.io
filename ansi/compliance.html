<p>
<font face=Helvetica size=8 color=blue><b>Q:</b></font>
What does it really mean for a program to be
``legal''
or
``valid''
or
``conforming''?
</p><p><hr>
<p>
<font face=Helvetica size=8 color=blue><b>A:</b></font>
Simply stated,
the
Standard talks about three
kinds of conformance:
conforming programs,
strictly conforming programs,
and
conforming implementations.
</p><p>A <a href="../sx1/index.html#conforming program"><dfn>conforming program</dfn></a> is one that is accepted by
a
conforming implementation.
</p><p>A <a href="../sx1/index.html#strictly conforming program"><dfn>strictly conforming program</dfn></a> is one that
does not depend on
any implementation-defined, unspecified, or undefined behavior,
that does not exceed any implementation limits,
and that otherwise uses
only the features of the language and library
as specified in the Standard.
</p><p>A <a href="../sx1/index.html#conforming implementation"><dfn>conforming implementation</dfn></a> is one that does everything the
Standard says it's supposed to.
(The way the Standard says this is that
a conforming implementation ``shall accept
any strictly conforming program''.)
There are two kinds of conforming implementation:
hosted and freestanding.
A <a href="../sx1/index.html#hosted implementation"><dfn>hosted implementation</dfn></a> is intended for use with conventional
application programs;
a <a href="../sx1/index.html#freestanding implementation"><dfn>freestanding implementation</dfn></a> is intended for use with
embedded systems and the like,
and is not required to supply all of the standard library functions.
</p><p>Unfortunately,
neither of
the definitions relating to conforming programs are
as practically useful as one might wish.
There are very few
realistic, useful, strictly conforming programs.
On the other hand, a
merely conforming program can make use of any compiler-specific
extension it wants to.
</p><p>Other words you may hear are
``compliant'' and ``conformant''
which are basically
just synonyms for
``conforming''.

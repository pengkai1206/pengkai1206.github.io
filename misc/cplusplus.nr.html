By C, the FAQ meant, and I guess we still mean, the current language,
not proposals for C9x.

There are a number of these.  I once worked out a pretty big list, but
do not remember it now.  However, you just asked for examples:
<p>
1) auto conversion from <TT>void&nbsp;*</TT> to any object/incomplete type:
<pre>
    void *one; char *two =one;
</pre>
<p>
2) new keywords (a number of these)
<pre>
    int new;
</pre>
<p>
3) due to structs becoming scoped
<pre>
      struct x {
        struct y { int z; } w;
      };
      struct y v;
</pre>
<p>
4) due to struct tags becoming typedefs:
<pre>
    struct y {int z;};
    int f(int(y)); f(3);
</pre>
<p>
5) due to prototypes being required
<pre>
     int f(); f(3);
</pre>
<p>
6) implicit int rules
<pre>
     main(){}
</pre>
<p>
7) Recursive call to main
<p>
8) Due to // comments
<pre>
   int x = 2//*why???*/2;
   int y;
</pre>
<p>
&gt; FAQ 20.27 also promised that "the two also define the meaning
<br>
&gt; of some common constructs differently".  I would like to see
<br>
&gt; some examples of that.
<p>
A few examples which come to mind immediately:
<p>
1) Due to // comments:
<pre>
   int x = 2//*why???*/2
   ;
</pre>
<p>
2) due to character literals being type <TT>char</TT> and not <TT>int</TT> etc.
<br>
So, if sizeof(int) != 1, 
<pre>
   sizeof('a')
</pre>
differs in the two languages
<p>
3) Due to struct scopes
<pre>
   struct y {int z;};
   {
    struct x {
        struct y { char z; } w;
    };
    struct y v;
    return sizeof v.z;
   }
</pre>
<p>
In addition, there are many cases where C compilers need to issue a
diagnostic, but which do not require diagnostic because they are valid
C++ code.  That is kind of obvious, and hence I do not provide examples.

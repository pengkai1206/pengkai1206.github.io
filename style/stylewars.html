<p>
<font face=Helvetica size=8 color=blue><b>Q:</b></font>
Some people say that <TT>goto</TT>'s are evil
and that I should never use them.
Isn't that a bit extreme?
</p><p><hr>
<p>
<font face=Helvetica size=8 color=blue><b>A:</b></font>
Programming style,
like writing style,
is
somewhat of
an art
and
cannot
be codified by inflexible rules,
although discussions about style often seem to center 
exclusively around such rules.
</p><p>In the case of the <TT>goto</TT> statement,
it
has long been observed
that unfettered use
of <TT>goto</TT>'s
quickly leads to unmaintainable spaghetti code.
However, a simple, unthinking ban on the <TT>goto</TT> statement 
does not necessarily lead immediately to beautiful programming:
an unstructured programmer is just as capable of constructing a 
Byzantine tangle without using any <TT>goto</TT>'s
(perhaps substituting oddly-nested loops and
Boolean
control 
variables, instead).
Many
programmers adopt a moderate stance:
<TT>goto</TT>'s are usually to be avoided,
but are acceptable in a few well-constrained situations,
if necessary:
as multi-level <TT>break</TT> statements,
to coalesce common actions
inside a <TT>switch</TT> statement,
or to centralize cleanup tasks
in a function with several error returns.
</p><p>Most observations or ``rules''
about programming style
(Structured Programming is Good,
<TT>goto</TT>'s are Bad,
functions should fit on one page,
etc.)
usually work better as guidelines than rules,
and work much better
if programmers understand what
the guidelines are trying to accomplish.
Blindly avoiding certain constructs
or following rules without understanding them
can lead to just as many problems
as the rules were supposed to avert.

</p><p>Furthermore, many opinions on programming style are just that: 
opinions.
They may be strongly argued and strongly felt, they may be 
backed up by solid-seeming evidence and arguments,
but the opposing opinions may be just as strongly
felt, supported, and argued.
It's usually futile to get dragged into ``style wars,'' because
on certain issues
(such as those referred to in questions
<a href="../null/ptrtest.html">5.3</a>,
<a href="../null/nullor0.html">5.9</a>,
<a href="../bool/macros.html">9.4</a>,
and
<a href="../cpp/nestincl.html">10.7</a>),
opponents can never
seem to
agree,
or
agree to disagree, or stop arguing.
</p><p>Finally,
as William Strunk has written
(quoted in the Introduction to
Strunk and White's classic <I>Elements of Style</I>),

<blockquote>It is an old observation
that the best writers sometimes disregard the rules of rhetoric.
When they do, however,
the reader will usually find in the sentence
some compensating merit,
attained at the cost of the violation.
Unless he is certain of doing as well,
he will probably do best to follow the rules.

<p>
False. ISO C (please get the name right) requires that the first bit
field be put into some addressable object, but there is no requirement
that it be a ``word'' (thus an 11 bit field might be put into a halfword
on a 32 bit system). If the following field will fit in the same object
it must be put there. If it doesn't it can be overlapped between two
objects or put into a new object. Thus:
<p>
<pre>
    int a : 11;
    int b :  2;
    int c : 11;
    int d :  7;
</pre>
<p>
could be packed as:
<p>
<pre>
    32-bit object: a, b, c, d
</pre>
<p>
or as:
<p>
<pre>
    16-bit object: a, b
    16-bit object: c
    16-bit object: d
</pre>
<p>
or as:
<p>
<pre>
    16-bit object: a, b, 3 bits of c
    16-bit object: 8 bits of c, d
</pre>

&gt; Q: How do I figure the ``true size'' (with trailing padding) of a type when
<br>
&gt; it occurs in a struct or array?
<p>
In a struct:
<p>
<pre>
    offsetof (structure, next field) - offsetof (structure, field)
</pre>
<p>
or:
<p>
<pre>
    sizeof (structure) - offsetof (structure, last field)
</pre>
<p>
There is no padding in an array.
<p>
&gt; A: By rounding up its apparent size to a multiple of its alignment.
<p>
Not necessarily. The padding can depend on what is following.
<p>
&gt; (assume a 32-bit architecture with normal C sizes
<br>
&gt; of long=4, int=4, short=2, and char=1 on all these unless otherwise
<br>
&gt; specified).
<p>
and assuming pointer=4.
<p>
&gt; (4) struct {char *; short; long;} will have a half-word of padding after
<br>
&gt; the short
<p>
or before it. On big-endian machines it may be easier to access the
half-word in the low-order half.
<p>
&gt; Q: How can I get complete control of the bit-level layout of a struct?
<br>
&gt; A: This is what bit-fields are for.  Declare all your members as bit fields.
<br>
&gt; The structure may still have invisible trailing padding (unless your last
<br>
&gt; bit field exactly fills to the end of the last machine word), but on modern
<br>
&gt; architectures this will eliminate all other padding and give you complete
<br>
&gt; control of the bit layout of the declared parts (albeit at a significant
<br>
&gt; cost in access time).  However, ANSI does <em>not</em> guarantee this well-
<br>
&gt; behavedness, so look out for snags.
<p>
Firstly, there may be padding whenever fields don't fit exactly. Secondly,
you still aren't guaranteed the order of the bit-fields within each
``addressable object''.
<p>
&gt; On some poorly-implemented C compilers on very old 36-bit word-oriented
<br>
&gt; architectures, even this may not be enough; a bit field that runs over
<br>
&gt; the end of a word boundary may force the next bit field to start at the
<br>
&gt; beginning of the following word, leaving an invisible gap of up to 35 bits.
<p>
Or on well-implemented compilers on modern architectures that choose not
to go to the effort of splitting bit-fields across word boundaries.
<p>
&gt; On these machines, your only option is to declare the struct as a single
<br>
&gt; char array and do the field accesses yourself in C.
<p>
And you still won't know the ordering of bits within the word relative
to the external format you are conforming to. This can't be solved in a
strictly conforming manner.

<p>
<font face=Helvetica size=8 color=blue><b>Q:</b></font>
How are integers converted to and from pointers?
Can I temporarily stuff an integer into a pointer,
or vice versa?
</p><p><hr>
<p>
<font face=Helvetica size=8 color=blue><b>A:</b></font>
Once upon a time,
it was guaranteed that a pointer could be converted to an integer
(though one never knew
whether an <TT>int</TT> or a <TT>long</TT> might be required),
and that an integer could be converted to a pointer,
and that a pointer remained unchanged when converted to a 
(large enough)
integer and back again,
and

that the conversions
(and any

mapping)
were intended to be
``unsurprising to those who know the addressing structure 
of the machine.''
In other words,
there is
some
precedent and
support for
integer/pointer
conversions,
but
they
have always been machine dependent,
and hence nonportable.
Explicit casts have always been required
(though early compilers rarely complained if you left them out).
</p><p>The ANSI/ISO C Standard,
in order to ensure that C is widely implementable,
has
weakened
those earlier guarantees.
Pointer-to-integer and integer-to-pointer conversions
are implementation-defined
(see question <a href="../ansi/undef.html">11.33</a>),
and
there
is no longer any guarantee that pointers can be converted 
to integers and back, without change.
</p><p>Forcing
pointers into integers,
or integers into pointers,
has never been good practice.
When you need a generic slot that can hold either
kind of data,
a union is a much better

idea.

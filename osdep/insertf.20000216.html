&gt; yes/no

<p>
Right.
<p>
&gt; if you don't mind could u calrify whether it is possible or not.

&gt; actually file appending is allowed in the same way why can't the

&gt; insertion of a line

The problem is that the basic model for file access under
virtually all operating systems is ``sequential'', meaning that
a file is a stream of bytes which you access sequentially.
It's easy to add bytes at the end (that's essentially what you
do every time you write to the file), but there's no way to
insert bytes in the middle.  You can usually seek back into the
file and start writing, but you overwrite, rather than inserting.
The only way for the OS to allow you to insert bytes would be if
it could move all the displaced bytes farther towards the end of
the file, but it turns out there's no reasonable way for the OS
to allow you to do that, at least not in an efficient or general
way.  (Some operating systems support record-oriented file types
which might allow you to insert records, but in that case you'd
be limited to inserting numbers of bytes which were an exact
multiple of the record size.)
<p>
The answer really is, ``You probably can't.''  If you could,
there would be a function call in C's stdio library with a
name like ``<TT>finsert</TT>'', and there would be a system call in the
operating system's filesystem interface with a name like
``<TT>insert</TT>''.  But neither of these calls exist, so whether we
wish there were a way to insert or not, there simply isn't;
the operating system and the C run-time library simply don't
support the operation.  (At some level, there's only one way to
write to a file, and if you're in the middle of the file when
you do it, the interpretation is ``overwrite'', not ``insert.'')
<p>
&gt; any other procedures is available
<p>
You really do have to rewrite the file if you want the effect
of inserting text in the middle.  This isn't too hard, really
(although I agree that sometimes it can be a nuisance).
<p>
You may be wondering why you can't insert characters in the
middle of a file, when it seems like text editors do it all the
time.  But text editors never work with a disk file directly;
they always work with fancier structures, either in memory or
in temporary files, which make inserting and deleting and
rearranging text relatively easy.  Whenever you edit a file,
the text editor reads the file into its internal data structures,
then lets you edit, then writes the modified data structures back
out to the file (overwriting the whole thing).

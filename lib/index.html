<H1>13. Library Functions</H1>

<p><a href="itoa.html" rel=subdocument>13.1</a>
How can I convert numbers to strings
(the opposite of <TT>atoi</TT>)?
Is there an <TT>itoa</TT> function?

</p><p><a href="strncpy.html" rel=subdocument>13.2</a>
Why does <TT>strncpy</TT> not always
place a <TT>'\0'</TT> terminator
in the destination string?
</p><p><a href="substr.html" rel=subdocument>13.3</a>
Does C have anything like the ``substr''
(extract substring)
routine present in other languages?
</p><p><a href="strupper.html" rel=subdocument>13.4</a>
How do I convert a string to all upper or lower case?

</p><p><a href="toupper.html" rel=subdocument>13.5</a>
Why
do some versions of
<TT>toupper</TT> act strangely if given an upper-case letter?
<br>Why does some code call <TT>islower</TT> before <TT>toupper</TT>?
</p><p><a href="strtok.html" rel=subdocument>13.6</a>
How can I split up a
string
into
whitespace-separated fields?
<br>How can I duplicate the process
by which <TT>main()</TT>
is handed <TT>argc</TT> and <TT>argv</TT>?
</p><p><a href="regex.html" rel=subdocument>13.7</a>
I need some code to do
regular expression
and
wildcard matching.
</p><p><a href="qsort1.html" rel=subdocument>13.8</a>
I'm trying to sort an array of strings with <TT>qsort</TT>,
using
<TT>strcmp</TT>
as the comparison function,
but it's not working.
</p><p><a href="qsort2.html" rel=subdocument>13.9</a>
Now I'm trying to sort an array of structures
with <TT>qsort</TT>.
My comparison function takes pointers to structures,
but the compiler
complains
that the function is
of the wrong type for <TT>qsort</TT>.
How can I cast the function pointer to shut off the warning?
</p><p><a href="listsort.html" rel=subdocument>13.10</a>
How can I sort a linked list?
</p><p><a href="extsort.html" rel=subdocument>13.11</a>
How can I sort more data than will fit in memory?
</p><p><a href="curtime.html" rel=subdocument>13.12</a>
How can I get the
current date
or
time of day in a C program?
</p><p><a href="mktime.html" rel=subdocument>13.13</a>
I know that the library function <TT>localtime</TT>
will convert a <TT>time_t</TT> into a broken-down <TT>struct&nbsp;tm</TT>,
and that <TT>ctime</TT>
will convert a
<TT>time_t</TT> to a printable string.
How can I
perform the inverse operations of converting
a <TT>struct&nbsp;tm</TT> or a string into a <TT>time_t</TT>?
</p><p><a href="calendar.html" rel=subdocument>13.14</a>
How can I add
N
days to a date?


How can I find the difference between two dates?

</p><p><a href="y2k.html" rel=subdocument>13.14b</a>
Did C have any Year 2000 problems?
</p><p><a href="rand.html" rel=subdocument>13.15</a>
I need a random number generator.
</p><p><a href="randrange.html" rel=subdocument>13.16</a>
How can I get random integers in a certain range?
</p><p><a href="srand.html" rel=subdocument>13.17</a>
Each time I run my program,
I get the same sequence of numbers back from <TT>rand()</TT>.
</p><p><a href="notveryrand.html" rel=subdocument>13.18</a>
I need a random true/false value,
so I'm just taking <TT>rand()&nbsp;%&nbsp;2</TT>,
but it's alternating 0, 1, 0, 1, 0...
</p><p><a href="shuffle.html" rel=subdocument>13.19</a>
How can I return a sequence of random numbers
which don't repeat at all?
</p><p><a href="fprand.html" rel=subdocument>13.19b</a>
How can I generate floating-point random numbers?
</p><p><a href="gaussian.html" rel=subdocument>13.20</a>
How can I generate random numbers with a
normal or
Gaussian distribution?
</p><p><a href="rand48.html" rel=subdocument>13.21</a>
I'm porting this program, and it calls a routine
<TT>drand48</TT>,
which my library doesn't have.
What is
it?
</p><p><a href="exitvsreturn.html" rel=subdocument>13.22</a>
Is <TT>exit(status)</TT> truly equivalent
to returning the same <TT>status</TT> from <TT>main</TT>?

</p><p><a href="memmove.html" rel=subdocument>13.23</a>
What's the difference between
<TT>memcpy</TT> and
<TT>memmove</TT>?


</p><p><a href="oldlibfcns.html" rel=subdocument>13.24</a>
I'm trying to port this old program.
Why do I get ``undefined external'' errors
for some library functions?
</p><p><a href="extlibs.html" rel=subdocument>13.25</a>
I
keep getting
errors due to library functions being undefined,
but I'm #including all
the right header files.
</p><p><a href="libsearch.html" rel=subdocument>13.26</a>
I'm still getting errors due to library functions being undefined,
even though I'm
explicitly
requesting the right libraries
while linking.
</p><p><a href="bloat.html" rel=subdocument>13.27</a>
Why is my simple program,
which hardly does more than print ``Hello, world!''
in a window,
compiling to such a huge executable
(several hundred K)?
Should I <TT>#include</TT> fewer header files?
</p><p><a href="endundef.html" rel=subdocument>13.28</a>
What does it mean when the linker says that <TT>_end</TT> is undefined?
</p><p><a href="noprintf.html" rel=subdocument>13.29</a>
My compiler is complaining that <TT>printf</TT> is undefined!
How can this be?
It's the world's most popular C function...

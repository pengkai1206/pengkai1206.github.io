</h1>
<p>
<font face=Helvetica size=8 color=blue><b>Q:</b></font>
Why is my simple program,
which hardly does more than print ``Hello, world!''
in a window,
compiling to such a huge executable
(several hundred K)?
Should I <TT>#include</TT> fewer header files?
</p><p><hr>
<p>
<font face=Helvetica size=8 color=blue><b>A:</b></font>
What you're seeing is the current
(poor)
state of the ``art'' in library design.
As run-time libraries accrete more and more features
(especially
having to do
with
Graphical User Interfaces),
and when one library function calls another library function to 
do part of its job
(which ought to be a Good Thing;
that's what library functions are for),
it
can happen
that
calling anything in the library
(particularly something relatively powerful like <TT>printf</TT>)
eventually pulls in practically everything
else,
leading to horribly bloated executables.
</p><p>#including fewer header files probably won't help,
because declaring a few functions which you don't call
(which is mostly all that happens when you #include a header 
you don't need)
shouldn't result in those functions being placed in your 
executable,
unless
they actually do get called.
See also question <a href="extlibs.html">13.25</a>.
</p><p>You may be able to track down
and derail
a
chain

of unnecessarily-coupled functions which are 

bloating your executable,
or maybe complain to your vendor to clean up the libraries.

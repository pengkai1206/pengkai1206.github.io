&gt;Null pointers work perfectly well on platforms where "address 0" can
<br>
&gt;point to a valid object. However there is a reason for why a null pointer
<br>
&gt;should <em>compare</em> equal to zero and that is that tests like <TT>if&nbsp;()</TT>
<br>
&gt;statements do the natural thing. Given that it makes sense for null
<br>
&gt;pointer constants to be defined in a consistent way.
<p>
The reason people find this confusing (and it's clear that lots of people
<em>do</em> find it confusing; I remember being very confused myself a while ago)
is, I think, that 0 changes in meaning depending on the situation in which
it's used.
<p>
Normally 0 means integer zero, but in some cases it means null pointer.
It's natural to try to find a link between these and think of the null
pointer as pointing to address 0, but as the FAQ makes clear this isn't a
valid approach.
<p>
We're all familiar with operators changing their meaning according to
context (the - operator behaving quite differently with pointers than with
numbers, for example), but it's more surprising to see a constant acting
that way.

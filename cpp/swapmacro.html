How can I write a generic macro to swap two values?
</p><p><hr>
<p>
<font face=Helvetica size=8 color=blue><b>A:</b></font>
There is no good answer to this question.
If the values are integers, a well-known trick using exclusive-OR


could perhaps
be used,
but it will not work for floating-point values or
pointers,
or if the two values are the same variable.
(See questions <a href="../expr/xorswapexpr.html">3.3b</a> and <a href="../misc/swapnotemp.html">20.15c</a>.)
If the macro is intended to be
used on values of arbitrary type
(the usual goal),
any solution involving a temporary variable is problematical,
because:
<UL><li>It's hard to give
the temporary
a name that won't clash with anything.
(Any name you pick
might be the actual name of one of the variables being swapped.
If you tried
using <TT>##</TT>
to concatenate the names of the two actual arguments,
to ensure that it won't match either one,
it might still not be unique
if the concatenated name is longer than 31 characters,
<a href="identl.html" rel=subdocument>[footnote]</a>
and it
wouldn't let you swap things like <TT>a[i]</TT> that aren't simple identifiers.
You could probably get away with using a name like <TT>_tmp</TT> 
in the ``no man's land'' between the user and 
implementation namespaces; see question <a href="../decl/namespace.html">1.29</a>.)
<li>Either it can't be declared with the right type
(because standard C does not provide a <TT>typeof</TT> operator),
or
(if it copies objects byte-by-byte,
perhaps with <TT>memcpy</TT>,
to a temporary array sized with <TT>sizeof</TT>)
the macro can't be used on operands which are declared <TT>register</TT>.
</UL></p><p>The best all-around solution is probably to forget about using a
macro,
unless you're willing to pass in the type as a third argument.


(Also,



if you're trying to swap entire structures or arrays,
you probably want to
exchange pointers
instead.)
If you're worried about the use of an ugly temporary, and know
that your machine provides an efficient exchange instruction, convince your
compiler vendor to recognize the standard three-assignment swap
idiom in the optimization phase.
</p><p>If you're consumed by a passionate desire
to solve this problem once and for all,
please reconsider;
there are better problems worthier of your energies.

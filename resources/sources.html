<p>
<font face=Helvetica size=8 color=blue><b>Q:</b></font>
Where
and how
can I get copies of all these freely distributable programs?
</p><p><hr>
<p>
<font face=Helvetica size=8 color=blue><b>A:</b></font>
As the number of available programs,
the number of publicly accessible archive sites,
and the number of people trying to access them
all grow,
this question becomes both easier and more difficult to answer.
</p><p>There are a number of
large,
public-spirited
archive sites
out there,
such as
<a href="ftp://ftp.uu.net"><TT>ftp.uu.net</TT></a>,

<a href="ftp://archive.umich.edu"><TT>archive.umich.edu</TT></a>,
<a href="ftp://oak.oakland.edu"><TT>oak.oakland.edu</TT></a>,
<a href="ftp://sumex-aim.stanford.edu"><TT>sumex-aim.stanford.edu</TT></a>,
and
<a href="ftp://wuarchive.wustl.edu"><TT>wuarchive.wustl.edu</TT></a>,

which have huge amounts of software
and other information
all freely
available.
For the FSF's GNU project,
the central distribution site is
<a href="ftp://prep.ai.mit.edu"><TT>prep.ai.mit.edu</TT></a>.
These well-known sites tend to be extremely busy and hard to reach,
but there are also numerous ``mirror'' sites
which try to spread the load around.
</p><p>On the connected Internet,
the traditional way to retrieve files from an archive site
is with anonymous ftp.
For those without ftp access,
there are also several ftp-by-mail servers in operation.

More and more,
the world-wide web (WWW)
is being used to
announce, index,
and even transfer
large data files.
There are probably yet newer access methods, too.
</p><p>Those are
some of
the easy parts of the question to answer.
The hard part is in the details--this
document cannot
begin to
track or
list all of the
available archive sites
or
all of the various ways of accessing them.
If you have access to the net at all,
you probably have access to more up-to-date information
about
active sites and useful access methods
than this
FAQ list
does.
</p><p>The other easy-and-hard aspect of the question,
of course,
is simply <em>finding</em>
which site
has what you're looking for.
There is a tremendous amount of work going on in this area,
and there are probably new indexing services springing up every day.
One of the first was ``archie'',
and of course there are a number of
high-profile commercial net indexing and searching services
such as Alta Vista, Excite, and Yahoo.

</p><p>If you have access to Usenet, see
the regular postings in the comp.sources.unix
and comp.sources.misc
newsgroups,
which describe
the archiving policies
for those groups
and how to
access their archives,

two of which are
<a href="ftp://gatekeeper.dec.com/pub/usenet/comp.sources.unix/"><TT>ftp://gatekeeper.dec.com/pub/usenet/comp.sources.unix/</TT></a>
and
<a href="ftp://ftp.uu.net/usenet/comp.sources.unix/"><TT>ftp://ftp.uu.net/usenet/comp.sources.unix/</TT></a>.
The
comp.archives newsgroup contains numerous
announcements of anonymous ftp availability of various items.
Finally, the
newsgroup comp.sources.wanted
is generally a more
appropriate place to post queries for source availability,
but check
<em>its</em>
FAQ list, ``How to find sources,''

before posting there.

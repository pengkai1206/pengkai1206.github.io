</DD><DT><a name="pcc"><TT>pcc</TT></a></DT>
<DD>n.
Steve Johnson's Portable C Compiler,
first written for the PDP-11
(as an alternative to Dennis Ritchie's <TT>cc</TT>)
circa
1978.


<TT>pcc</TT> was retargeted to the VAX during the Unix 32V and BSD
projects
and saw <em>very</em> wide distribution,
and served as the base for a large number of C compilers.
As much as K&amp;R1, it served as the <I>de facto</I> definition
of C for many years,
until X3J11 began its work.
(Note that the PCC mentioned in question <a href="../resources/compilers.html">18.3</a>
is probably no relation.)
</DD><DT><a name="precedence">precedence</a></DT>
<DD>n.
The ``strength'' of an operator,
indicating how tightly it binds to its operands during parsing,
especially as compared to other nearby operators.
Along with associativity and explicit parentheses,
precedence determines how an expression is parsed:
which operators are applied to which operands and
which subexpressions are the operands of which operators.
Precedence does not necessarily say anything about
<a href="index.html#order of evaluation"><dfn>order of evaluation</dfn></a> (q.v.);
see question <a href="../expr/precvsooe.html">3.4</a>.
</DD><DT><a name="preprocessor">preprocessor</a></DT>
<DD>n.
The part of a compiler
(traditionally, a separate program; hence the name)
which handles the <TT>#include</TT>, <TT>#define</TT>, <TT>#ifdef</TT>,
and related directives,
and performs substitution of <TT>#define</TT>d macros
in the rest of the
program source.
</DD><DT><a name="pointer context">pointer context</a></DT>
<DD>n.
An expression
context

in which it
can be recognized
that a pointer value is required.
The pointer contexts in C are:

<br>
<br>
(1)
any <a href="index.html#assignment context"><dfn>assignment context</dfn></a> (q.v.)
in which the destination
(left-hand side) has pointer type;
<br>
<br>
(2)
an <TT>==</TT> or <TT>!=</TT> comparison in which one side has
pointer type;
<br>
<br>
(3)
the second and third operands of the <TT>?:</TT> operator, when one
of them is a pointer;
and

<br>
<br>
(4)
the operand of a pointer cast,
such as <TT>(char&nbsp;*)</TT> or <TT>(void&nbsp;*)</TT>.
<br>
<br>
See question <a href="../null/null2.html">5.2</a>.
</DD><DT><a name="pun">pun</a></DT>
<DD>vt.
To
contrive to

treat
an object
as if it had
a different type,
usually by using a union
or an expression of the form <TT>*(othertype&nbsp;*)&amp;object</TT>.
</DD><DT><a name="ragged array">ragged array</a></DT>
<DD>n.
An array,
usually simulated with pointers,
in which the rows are not necessarily of the same length.
See also <a href="index.html#dope vector"><dfn>dope vector</dfn></a>.
See questions <a href="../aryptr/dynmuldimary.html">6.16</a>
and <a href="../misc/ragged.html">20.2</a>.
</DD><DT><a name="reentrant">reentrant</a></DT>
<DD>adj.
Refers to code which can safely be called
from interrupts
or in other circumstances
in which it is possible
that another instance of the code is simultaneously active.
Reentrant code has to be very careful of the way it
manipulates data:
the data
must either all be local,
or else protected by semaphores or
the like.
</DD><DT><a name="RFC">RFC</a></DT>
<DD>n.
An internet
Request For Comments document,
available by ftp from ds.internic.net and many other sites.
</DD><DT><a name="rhs">rhs</a></DT>
<DD>n.
The right-hand side,
usually of an assignment,
or more generally,
of any binary operator.
</DD><DT><a name="rvalue">rvalue</a></DT>
<DD>n.
Originally,
an
expression
which could appear
on the right-hand sign of an assignment operator.
More generally,
any
value which can participate in an expression or be
assigned to some other variable.


In the assignment
<pre>
	a = b;
</pre>
<TT>b</TT> is an rvalue, and has its value fetched.
Compare <a href="index.html#lvalue"><dfn>lvalue</dfn></a>.
See ANSI Sec. 3.2.2.1 (especially footnote 31)
or ISO Sec. 6.2.2.1.

</DD><DT><a name="semantics">semantics</a></DT>
<DD>n.
The meaning behind a program:
the interpretation which the compiler
(or other translator)
places on the various source code constructs.
Compare <a href="index.html#syntax"><dfn>syntax</dfn></a>.
</DD><DT><a name="short circuit">short circuit</a></DT>
<DD>v.
To prematurely terminate the evaluation of an expression
when the outcome is
determined.
The short-circuiting operators in C are <TT>&amp;&amp;</TT>, <TT>||</TT>,
and <TT>?:</TT>.
In the case of <TT>&amp;&amp;</TT> and <TT>||</TT>,
the second (right-hand) operand is not evaluated if the first one
determines the
outcome
(is zero in the case of <TT>&amp;&amp;</TT>,
or nonzero in the case of <TT>||</TT>).

In the case of <TT>?:</TT>, only one of the second and third
operands is evaluated,
depending on the value of the first operand.
See question <a href="../expr/shortcircuit.html">3.6</a>.
</DD><DT><a name="side effect">side effect</a></DT>
<DD>n.
Something
permanent
which happens
when an expression or subexpression is evaluated,
beyond
simply yielding a value.

Typical side effects are:
modifying a variable,

printing something.
See ANSI Sec. 2.1.2.3 or ISO Sec. 5.1.2.3.

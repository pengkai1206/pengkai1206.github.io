<font face=Helvetica size=8 color=blue><b>Q:</b></font>
How can I implement a delay,
or time a user's response,
with sub-second resolution?

Unfortunately, there is no portable way.
Routines
you might look for on your system include
<TT>clock</TT>,



<TT>delay</TT>,
<TT>ftime</TT>,
<TT>gettimeofday</TT>,
<TT>msleep</TT>,
<TT>nap</TT>,



<TT>napms</TT>,




<TT>nanosleep</TT>,
<TT>setitimer</TT>,
<TT>sleep</TT>,




<TT>Sleep</TT>,
<TT>times</TT>,
and
<TT>usleep</TT>.
(A function called <TT>wait</TT>,
however,
is at least under Unix <em>not</em> what you want.)
The <TT>select</TT> and <TT>poll</TT> calls
(if available)
can be pressed into
service to implement simple delays.
On MS-DOS machines, it is possible to reprogram the system timer
and timer interrupts.

</p><p>Of these,
only
<TT>clock</TT> is part of the ANSI Standard.
The difference between two calls to <TT>clock</TT>

gives elapsed



execution
time,
and
may even
have subsecond resolution,
if CLOCKS_PER_SEC
is greater than 1.
However, <TT>clock</TT> gives
elapsed
processor time
used by the current program,
which
on a multitasking system
(or in a non-CPU-intensive program)
may
differ considerably from
real time.
</p><p>If you're trying to implement a delay
and all you have available
is a time-reporting function,
you can implement a
CPU-intensive
busy-wait,
but this is only
an
option on a single-user, single-tasking machine,
as it is terribly antisocial
to any other processes.
Under a multitasking operating system,
be sure to use
a
call
which puts your process to sleep for the duration,
such as <TT>sleep</TT> or <TT>select</TT>,
or <TT>pause</TT>
in conjunction with <TT>alarm</TT> or <TT>setitimer</TT>.
</p><p>For really brief delays,
it's tempting to use a do-nothing loop like
<pre>
	long int i;
	for(i = 0; i &lt; 1000000; i++)
		;
</pre>
but resist this temptation if at all possible!
For one thing,
your carefully-calculated delay loops
will
stop working
properly
next month when a faster processor comes out.
Perhaps
worse,

a
clever
compiler may notice that the loop does nothing
and optimize it away completely.

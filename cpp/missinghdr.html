<p>
<font face=Helvetica size=8 color=blue><b>Q:</b></font>
I'm compiling a program, and
I seem to be missing
one
of the
header files it
requires.
Can someone send me
a copy?
</p><p><hr>
<p>
<font face=Helvetica size=8 color=blue><b>A:</b></font>
There are several situations, depending on what sort of header
file it is that's ``missing''.
</p><p>If the missing header file is
truly
a standard one
(that is,
one defined by the ANSI C Standard,
such as <TT>&lt;stdio.h&gt;</TT>),
there's a problem with your compiler.
Either
the compiler
wasn't installed properly,
or your project is somehow not configured
to find the standard header files.
You'll need to contact your vendor,
or someone knowledgeable about your particular compiler,
for help.
</p><p>In
the case of nonstandard headers,
the situation is considerably more complicated.
Some
headers
(such as <TT>&lt;dos.h&gt;</TT>)
are completely system- or compiler-specific.
Some
are completely unnecessary,
and should be replaced by
their Standard equivalents.
(For example,
instead of
the nonstandard
<TT>&lt;malloc.h&gt;</TT>
and
<TT>&lt;memory.h&gt;</TT>,
portable
source code should instead <TT>#include</TT>
<TT>&lt;stdlib.h&gt;</TT>
and
<TT>&lt;string.h&gt;</TT>,
respectively.)
Other
headers,
such as those associated with popular add-on libraries,
may be reasonably portable.
</p><p>If the missing header file is an OS-specific one,
such as
<TT>&lt;sgtty.h&gt;</TT>,
<TT>&lt;sys/stat.h&gt;</TT>,
<TT>&lt;netinet/in.h&gt;</TT>,
or
<TT>&lt;dos.h&gt;</TT>,
it may be that the program you're compiling was
tailored to
an operating system other than the one you're using.
(It's also possible that
some conditional compilation settings need to be adjusted.)




It likely won't be possible to get the program working
without rewriting its system-dependent portions.
Simply getting copies of the missing header files wouldn't help--they
typically contain declarations of the interfaces
to the various system calls and libraries.
Obtaining copies of the header files wouldn't get you copies of the libraries,
and the libraries wouldn't be of any use
(that is, they wouldn't work)
without the underlying system calls, anyway.

</p><p>If the missing header file is for
some external, add-on, third-party
library,
look for the header where you got the library.
If you have some source code
which #includes what appears to be an add-on header,
but
which

you don't have,
you probably don't have the library, either,
and you'll need both.
See question <a href="../lib/extlibs.html">13.25</a>;
see also question <a href="../resources/sources.html">18.16</a>.
</p><p>If the header file is unique to
(that is, part of)
the program you're trying to compile,
your search will obviously begin
at the spot
where you found the program.
(Again, see question <a href="../resources/sources.html">18.16</a>.)
</p><p>In general, however, asking if someone can
``send you a copy''
of a missing header file is not likely to be productive.
Standard headers exist in part so that definitions appropriate to your
compiler,
operating system,
and
processor
can be supplied.
You cannot
just
pick up a copy of someone else's header file
and expect it to work,
unless that person is using exactly the same environment.
Nonstandard headers--such as
those specific to
a particular operating system
or third-party library--aren't
generally any more portable;
the OS-specific ones are likely to be <em>very</em> specific
to a particular version and release of the OS,
and the third-party ones are likely to be equally tied
to a particular version of the library.
</p><p>The bottom line is that
a random person on the net
is unlikely to be able to send you a working copy
of the header file you
(seem to)
need.
You may actually have a
portability problem

(see section <a href="../osdep/index.html">19</a>),
or a compiler problem
(in which case you might be able to
ask your compiler vendor why the file was not provided,
or to send a replacement copy).
Otherwise
(if the header is third-party or application-specific),
see question <a href="../resources/sources.html">18.16</a>.

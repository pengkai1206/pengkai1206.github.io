<title>comp.lang.c FAQ list: Introduction</title>
</head>
<body bgcolor="#ffffff">

[This is the introductory text for the plain-text version
of the C FAQ list, as posted to its original home,
namely the Usenet newsgroup <a href="news:comp.lang.c">comp.lang.c</a>.]

<p>Certain topics come up again and again
on

this newsgroup.
They
are good questions, and the answers may not be immediately obvious,
but each time they recur, much net bandwidth and reader time is
wasted on repetitive responses,

and on tedious
corrections to any incorrect answers
which may unfortunately
be posted.
This article, which is posted monthly, attempts to
answer these common questions definitively
and succinctly,
so
that net discussion can move on to more constructive topics
without continual regression to first principles.
</p><p>No mere newsgroup article can substitute for thoughtful perusal
of a full-length

tutorial or
language reference manual.
Anyone interested
enough in C to be following this newsgroup should also be
interested enough to read and study one or more such manuals,
preferably several times.
Some
C books
and
compiler manuals
are
unfortunately inadequate;
a few even perpetuate some of the myths
which this article attempts to refute.


Several noteworthy books on C are listed in this article's

bibliography;
see also questions
<a href="resources/tutorials.html">18.19</a>
and
<a href="resources/books.html">18.10</a>.
Many of the questions and answers
are cross-referenced to these books,
for further study by the interested and dedicated reader.
</p><br><p>If you have a question about C
which is not answered in this article,
you might
first try

to answer it by checking a few of the referenced books,
or one of the expanded versions mentioned below,
before posing your question to the net at large.
There are many people on the net who are happy to answer questions,
but the volume of repetitive answers posted to one question,
as well as the growing number of questions
as the net attracts more readers,
can become

oppressive.
If you have questions or comments prompted by this article,
please reply by mail rather than following
up--this article is
meant to decrease net traffic, not increase it.
</p><p>Besides listing frequently-asked questions,
this article also summarizes frequently-posted answers.
Even if you know all the answers,
it's worth skimming through this list once in a while,
so that when you see one of its

questions unwittingly posted,
you won't have to waste

time answering.
(However,
this is a large and heavy document,
so don't assume that everyone on the net
has managed to read all of it in detail,
and please don't roll it up and thwack people over the head with it
just because they missed their answer in it.)

Usenet.
It may,
however,
be out-of-date,

or one retrieved from a tertiary archive site

Since this list is modified from time to time,
its question numbers may not match those
in older or newer copies which are in circulation,
so
be careful when referring to FAQ list entries by number alone.
(Also, this article was produced for free redistribution.
You should not need to pay anyone for a copy of it.)
</p><p>Several other versions of this document are available.
Posted along with it are an abridged version
and
(when there are changes)
a list of differences with respect to the previous version.
A hypertext version is available on the
web at the aforementioned URL.
For those who might prefer a bound, hardcopy version,
a book-length version has been published by Addison-Wesley
(ISBN 0-201-84519-9).
The hypertext and book versions
include additional questions and more detailed answers,
so you might want to check one of them
if you still have questions
after reading this posted list.
</p><p>This article can always be improved.
Your input is welcome.
Send your comments to
scs@eskimo.com .
</p><p>(The question numbers
within each section
are not always continuous,
because they are aligned with the aforementioned book-length version,
which contains even more questions.)

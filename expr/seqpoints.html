</h1>
<p>
<font face=Helvetica size=8 color=blue><b>Q:</b></font>
How can I understand
complex expressions like the ones in this section,
and avoid writing undefined ones?
What's a ``sequence point''?
</p><p><hr>
<p>
<font face=Helvetica size=8 color=blue><b>A:</b></font>
A sequence point

is
a
point
in time
at which
the dust
has settled
and
all side effects
which have been seen so far
are guaranteed to be complete.

The sequence points listed in the C standard are:
<UL><li>at the end of
the evaluation of
a <a href="../sx1/index.html#full expression"><dfn>full expression</dfn></a>
(a full expression is an expression statement,
or any other expression which is not
a subexpression within
any larger expression);
<li>at the <TT>||</TT>, <TT>&amp;&amp;</TT>, <TT>?:</TT>, and comma operators;
and
<li>at a function call
(after the evaluation of all the arguments,
and
just before the actual call).
</UL></p><p>The
Standard states that

<blockquote>Between the previous and next sequence point
an object shall have its stored value modified
at most once by the evaluation of an expression.
Furthermore,
the prior value shall be accessed only
to determine the value to be stored.
</blockquote></p><p>
These two rather opaque sentences
say several things.
First,
they talk about operations bounded by
the
``previous and next sequence points'';
such operations
usually correspond to

full expressions.

(In an expression statement,
the ``next sequence point''
is
usually

at the terminating semicolon,
and the ``previous sequence point''

is
at the end of the previous
statement.
An expression may also contain intermediate
sequence points,
as listed above.)
</p><p>The first sentence rules out both the examples

<pre>
	i++ * i++
</pre>
and
<pre>
	i = i++
</pre>
from questions <a href="evalorder2.html">3.2</a>
and <a href="ieqiplusplus.html">3.3</a>--in both cases,
<TT>i</TT> has its value modified twice within the expression,
i.e. between sequence points.
(If we were to write a similar expression
which
did

have an internal sequence point,
such as
<pre>
	i++ &amp;&amp; i++
</pre>
it <em>would</em> be well-defined,
if questionably useful.)
</p><p>The second sentence

can be
quite
difficult to understand.
It turns out that it disallows code like
<pre>
	a[i] = i++
</pre>
from question <a href="evalorder1.html">3.1</a>.
(Actually, the other expressions we've been discussing
are in violation of the second sentence, as well.)
To see why,
let's first look more carefully
at what the Standard is trying to allow and disallow.
</p><p>Clearly,
expressions like
<pre>
	a = b
</pre>
and
<pre>
	c = d + e
</pre>
which read

some values and use them to write others,
are well-defined and

legal.
Clearly,

<a href="fn16.html" rel=subdocument>[footnote]</a>
expressions like
<pre>
	i = i++
</pre>
which modify the same value twice
are abominations
which needn't be allowed
(or in any case,
needn't be well-defined,
i.e. we don't have to figure out a way to say what they do,

and compilers don't have to support them).

Expressions
like these
are disallowed by the first sentence.
</p><p>It's also clear
<a href="fn16.html" rel=subdocument>[footnote]</a>
that we'd like to disallow expressions like
<pre>
	a[i] = i++
</pre>
which modify <TT>i</TT> <em>and</em> use it along the way,
but not disallow expressions like
<pre>
	i = i + 1
</pre>
which
use and modify <TT>i</TT>

but only modify it
later


when it's reasonably easy to ensure
that the final store of the final value
(into <TT>i</TT>, in this case)
doesn't interfere with

the
earlier
accesses.
</p><p>And that's

what the second sentence says:
if an object is written to within a full expression,
any
and all

accesses to it within the same expression
must be
directly involved in the computation of
the value to be written.
This rule effectively constrains legal expressions
to those in which the accesses demonstrably precede
the
modification.
For example,
the old standby
<TT>i&nbsp;=&nbsp;i&nbsp;+&nbsp;1</TT> is
allowed,
because the access of <TT>i</TT> is used to determine <TT>i</TT>'s final value.
The example
<pre>
	a[i] = i++
</pre>
is disallowed because one of the accesses
of <TT>i</TT>
(the one in <TT>a[i]</TT>)
has nothing to do
with the value which ends up being stored in <TT>i</TT>
(which happens over in <TT>i++</TT>),
and so there's no good way to
define--either for our understanding
or the compiler's--whether the access should take place 
before or after the incremented value is stored.
Since there's no good way to define it,
the Standard declares that it is undefined,
and that portable programs
simply must not use such constructs.

How can I convert integers to
binary or
hexadecimal?

Make sure you really know what you're asking.
Integers are stored internally in binary,
although for most purposes it is not incorrect
to think of them as being in
octal, decimal, or hexadecimal,
whichever is convenient.
The base in which a number is expressed matters only when that
number is read in from or written out to the outside world,
either in the form of
a source code constant
or in the form of I/O
performed by a program.
</p><p>In source code,
a non-decimal base is indicated
by
a leading <TT>0</TT> or <TT>0x</TT>
(for octal or hexadecimal, respectively).
During I/O, the base of a formatted number is controlled
in the
<TT>printf</TT>
and <TT>scanf</TT>
family
of functions
by the choice of format specifier
(<TT>%d</TT>, <TT>%o</TT>, <TT>%x</TT>, etc.)
and in the <TT>strtol</TT>
and <TT>strtoul</TT>
functions
by the third argument.
During
<em>binary</em> I/O,
however, the base again becomes immaterial:

if numbers are being read or written as individual bytes
(typically with <TT>getc</TT> or <TT>putc</TT>),
or as multi-byte words
(typically with <TT>fread</TT> or <TT>fwrite</TT>),
it is meaningless to ask what ``base'' they are in.
</p><p>If what you need is formatted binary conversion,
it's easy enough to do.
Here is a little function
for formatting
a number in a requested base:


<pre>
char *
baseconv(unsigned int num, int base)
{
	static char retbuf[33];
	char *p;

	if(base &lt; 2 || base &gt; 16)
		return NULL;

	p = &amp;retbuf[sizeof(retbuf)-1];
	*p = '\0';

	do {
		*--p = "0123456789abcdef"[num % base];
		num /= base;
	} while(num != 0);

	return p;
}
</pre>

(Note that this function, as written,
returns a pointer to static data,
such that only one of its return values can be used at a time;
see question <a href="../malloc/retaggr.html">7.5a</a>.
A better size for the <TT>retbuf</TT> array
would be <TT>sizeof(int)*CHAR_BIT+1</TT>;
see question <a href="../stdio/sprintfsize.html">12.21</a>.)
</p><p>For more information about ``binary'' I/O,
see
questions <a href="../struct/io.html">2.11</a>, <a href="../stdio/binaryio.html">12.37</a>, and <a href="../stdio/extconform.html">12.42</a>.

two more-recent ideas I've received on the subject.]

Besides the ideas I passed along in that other message, here are
two I've received more recently from other netters.  Fermin
Javier Reig had a variation on the idea of using an interface
like
<p><pre><TT>
	Push(arg1);
	Push(arg2);
	...
	Call(func);
</TT></pre><p>
, although his idea ran into several problems of its own, and
anyway it addresses the part of the problem that you've already
solved, so I won't say more about it here.  Jonathan Thompson had
the idea of "creating a very large structure of <TT>char</TT>s", filling
in that structure with an image of the argument list (i.e. the
stack frame) to be built, and then passing what looks like a
single argument, i.e. that one structure, to the called function,
which could -- with luck -- interpret it as multiple arguments.
I think this trick could be made to work on some machines,
although I haven't experimented with it yet, and it obviously
assumes a pure stack calling model, i.e. it wouldn't work at all
on a register-passing machine.

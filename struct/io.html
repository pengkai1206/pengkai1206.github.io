<p>
<font face=Helvetica size=8 color=blue><b>Q:</b></font>
How can I read/write structures from/to

data files?

</p><p><hr>
<p>
<font face=Helvetica size=8 color=blue><b>A:</b></font>
It is relatively straightforward
to write a structure
out
using <TT>fwrite</TT>:
<pre>
	fwrite(&amp;somestruct, sizeof somestruct, 1, fp);
</pre>

and a corresponding
<TT>fread</TT> invocation can read it back in.
What happens here is that
<TT>fwrite</TT> receives a pointer to the structure,
and writes
(or <TT>fread</TT> correspondingly reads)
the memory image of the structure
as a stream of bytes.
The <TT>sizeof</TT> operator determines
how many bytes the structure occupies.
</p><p>(The
call to <TT>fwrite</TT> above is correct
under an ANSI compiler
as long as a prototype for <TT>fwrite</TT> is in scope,
usually because <TT>&lt;stdio.h&gt;</TT> is <TT>#include</TT>d.
</p><p>However,
data files
written
as memory images
in this way
will
<em>not</em>
be
portable,
particularly
if they contain floating-point fields or pointers.
The memory layout of structures is
machine and
compiler dependent.
Different compilers may use different amounts of padding
(see question <a href="padding.html">2.12</a>),
and
the sizes and byte orders of fundamental types
vary across machines.
Therefore,
structures written as memory images
cannot necessarily be read back in
by programs running on other machines
(or even compiled by other compilers),
and this is an
important concern if
the data files you're writing
will ever be interchanged between machines.
See also

questions
<a href="padding.html">2.12</a>
and
<a href="../misc/binaryfiles.html">20.5</a>.
</p><p>Also,
if the structure contains any pointers
(<TT>char&nbsp;*</TT> strings,
or pointers to other data structures),
only the pointer values will be written,
and they are most unlikely to be valid when read back in.
Finally,
note
that
for widespread portability
you must use the <TT>"b"</TT> flag
when opening the files;
see question <a href="../stdio/fopenbinary.html">12.38</a>.
</p><p>A more portable solution,
though it's a bit more work initially,
is to write a pair of functions
for writing and reading a structure,
field-by-field,
in a portable
(perhaps even human-readable)
way.

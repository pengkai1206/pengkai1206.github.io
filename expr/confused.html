<font face=Helvetica size=8 color=blue><b>Q:</b></font>
How can I avoid these undefined evaluation order difficulties
if I don't feel like learning the complicated rules?
</p><p><hr>
<p>
<font face=Helvetica size=8 color=blue><b>A:</b></font>
The easiest answer
is that if you steer clear of expressions
which don't have
reasonably
obvious
interpretations,
for the most part you'll steer clear of
the undefined ones,
too.
(Of course,
``reasonably obvious''
means different things to different people.
This answer works as long as you agree
that
<TT>a[i]&nbsp;=&nbsp;i++</TT> and <TT>i&nbsp;=&nbsp;i++</TT>
are not ``reasonably obvious.'')
</p><p>To be a bit more precise,
here are some
simpler rules which,
though slightly more conservative than
the ones in the Standard,
will
help to
make sure that your code is
``reasonably obvious''
and
equally understandable to both 
the compiler <em>and</em> your fellow programmers:
<OL><li>Make sure that each
expression
modifies at most one object.
By ``object'' we mean either
a simple variable,
or
a cell of an array,
or
the
location
pointed to by a pointer (e.g. <TT>*p</TT>).
A ``modification'' is either
simple assignment with the <TT>=</TT> operator,
or
a compound assignment
with an operator like <TT>+=</TT>, <TT>-=</TT>, or <TT>*=</TT>,
or an increment or decrement with <TT>++</TT> or <TT>--</TT>
(in either pre or post forms).
<li>If an object
(as defined above)
appears more than once in an expression,
and is the object modified in the expression,
make sure that
<em>all</em> appearances of the object
which fetch its value
participate in the computation of the new value which is stored.
This rule allows the expression
<pre>
	i = i + 1
</pre>
because although the object <TT>i</TT> appears twice and is modified,
the appearance 
(on the right-hand side)
which fetches <TT>i</TT>'s old value
is used to compute <TT>i</TT>'s new value.
<li>If you want to break rule 1,
make sure that the several objects being modified are distinctly different,

and try to limit yourself to two or at most three modifications,
and of a style matching those of the following examples.
(Also,
make sure that you continue to follow rule 2

for each object modified.)

The expression
<pre>
	c = *p++
</pre>
is allowed under this rule,
because the two objects modified 
(<TT>c</TT> and <TT>p</TT>)
are distinct.
The expression
<pre>
	*p++ = c
</pre>
is also allowed,
because <TT>p</TT> and <TT>*p</TT>
(i.e. <TT>p</TT> itself and what it points to)
are both modified but are almost certainly distinct.
Similarly, both
<pre>
	c = a[i++]
and
	a[i++] = c
</pre>
are allowed,
because <TT>c</TT>, <TT>i</TT>, and <TT>a[i]</TT> are
presumably

all distinct.
Finally, expressions like
<pre>
	*p++ = *q++
</pre>
and
<pre>
	a[i++] = b[j++]
</pre>
in which <em>three</em> things are modified
(<TT>p</TT>, <TT>q</TT>, and <TT>*p</TT> in the first expression,
and <TT>i</TT>, <TT>j</TT>, and <TT>a[i]</TT> in the second),
are allowed <em>if</em> all three objects are distinct,
i.e. only if two <em>different</em> pointers <TT>p</TT> and <TT>q</TT>
or two <em>different</em> array indices <TT>i</TT> and <TT>j</TT>
are used.
<li>You may also break rule 1 or 2
as long as you interpose
a defined sequence point operator
between the two modifications,
or between the modification and the access.
The expression
<pre>
	(c = getchar()) != EOF &amp;&amp; c != '\n'
</pre>
(commonly seen in a <TT>while</TT> loop while
reading a line)
is legal because
the second access of the variable <TT>c</TT>
occurs after the sequence point implied by <TT>&amp;&amp;</TT>.
(Without the sequence point,
the expression would be illegal
because the access of <TT>c</TT> while comparing it to <TT>'\n'</TT>
on the right
does

not ``determine the value to be stored''
on the left.)

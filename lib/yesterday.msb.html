&gt; In my C manual the time.h and time functions are described

<br>
&gt; month, day, day-of-the-year), but it isn't clear to me how to subtract
<br>
&gt; a day.
<p>
This is question 13.14 on the FAQ list, but I'd like to expand a bit
on what it says there.
<p>
Bruce, you have gotten as far as calling <TT>time()</TT> and <TT>localtime()</TT>.  The
next thing is to use the normalizing feature of <TT>mktime()</TT>.  Suppose that
you have a variable of type <TT>struct&nbsp;tm</TT> called <TT>x</TT>, and you've just put the
current time into it using <TT>localtime()</TT>.  Now you basically just want to
do something like this:
<p>
<pre>
	x.tm_day--;      	/* back 1 day */
	(void) mktime (&amp;x);	/* normalize */
</pre>
<p>
And probably someone is going to post to suggest just that.  The above
code will work most of the time, but it has two problems.  First, <TT>mktime()</TT>
is allowed to fail, so it's as well to check for it and report the error.
<p>
Second, it finds the date 24 hours ago.  If there was a daylight saving
time transition, 24 hours ago might be today or the day before yesterday.
<p>
You might think to fix the first problem by adding the line:
<pre>
	x.tm_isdst = -1;
</pre>
at the top, effectively forcing <TT>mktime()</TT> to work by wall clock time.
Now you are asking for the same time yesterday, rather than the time 24
hours ago.  But this doesn't fix the problem -- in the case of a daylight
saving time transition, ``the same time yesterday'' might be ambiguous or
not exist.  In such a case a failure of <TT>mktime()</TT> is allowed (or perhaps
required, depending on how one interprets the standard).
<p>
The correct fix is to let the daylight saving time transition take its
effect by leaving <TT>tm_isdst</TT> alone, but to ask for the time 24 hours before
a time near noon today.  Even if that time is 11 am or 1 pm, it will still
be yesterday.  So the final version of the code is:
<p>
<pre>
	x.tm_day--;      	/* back 1 day (well, 24 hours) */
	x.tm_hour = 12;         /* from some time between noon and 1 pm */

				/* and normalize */
	if (mktime (&amp;x) == (time_t) -1) {
		fprintf (stderr, "mktime failed!!\n");
		exit(1);
	}
</pre>
<p>
The structure now contains the correct year, month, and day values for
yesterday.  As always, remember that the representation of a <TT>struct&nbsp;tm</TT>
requires you to add 1900 to the year and 1 to the month to get the correct
values if displaying them numerically.
<p>
There is a terser version of the ``final'' code: replace the first two lines by
<pre>
	x.tm_hour = -12;	/* 12 hours before sometime between
				 * midnight and 1 am this morning */
</pre>
but the meaning of this is less obvious, so I don't recommend it.

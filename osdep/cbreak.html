<!-- qtag -->Question 19.1
</h1>
<p>
<font face=Helvetica size=8 color=blue><b>Q:</b></font>
How can I read a single character from the keyboard without
waiting for
the RETURN key?
How can I stop characters from being
echoed

on the screen as they're typed?
</p><p><hr>
<p>
<font face=Helvetica size=8 color=blue><b>A:</b></font>

Alas,



there is no standard or portable way to do
these things
in C.
Concepts such as screens
and keyboards are not even mentioned
in the Standard,
which deals only with simple I/O ``streams''
of characters.
</p><p>Input to a computer program
typically
passes through several stages.
At the lowest level,
device-dependent routines
within the operating system
handle the details of interfacing with particular devices
such as keyboards, serial lines, disk drives, etc.
Above that,
modern operating systems tend to have
a device-independent I/O layer,
unifying access
to any file or device.
Finally,
a C program is usually insulated
from the operating system's I/O facilities
by the portable functions of the stdio library.
</p><p>At some level,
interactive keyboard input is usually
collected 
and presented to the requesting program
a line at a time.
This gives the operating system a chance
to support input line editing
(backspace/delete/rubout, etc.)
in a consistent way,
without requiring that it
be built into every program.
Only when the user is satisfied and presses the RETURN key
(or equivalent)
is the line made available to the calling program.

Even if the calling program appears to be reading input
a character at a time
(with <TT>getchar</TT> or the like),
the first call

blocks until the user has typed an entire line,
at which point potentially many
characters become available
and many character requests
(e.g. <TT>getchar</TT> calls)
are satisfied in quick succession.
</p><p>When a program wants to
read each character immediately as it arrives,
its
course of action
will depend on
where in the input stream the line collection
is happening
and how it can be disabled.
Under some systems
(e.g. MS-DOS, VMS in some modes),
a program can use
a different
or modified
set of OS-level input calls
to bypass line-at-a-time input processing.
Under other systems
(e.g. Unix, VMS in other modes),
the part of the operating system responsible for serial input
(often called the ``terminal driver'')
must be placed in a mode which
turns off
line-at-a-time 
processing,
after which
all calls to
the usual input routines

(e.g. <TT>read</TT>,
<TT>getchar</TT>, etc.)
will return characters immediately.
Finally,
a few
systems
(particularly older, batch-oriented mainframes)
perform input processing
in

peripheral processors which cannot be told
to do anything other than line-at-a-time input.
</p><p>Therefore,
when you need to do character-at-a-time input
(or disable keyboard echo,
which
is an analogous problem),
you will
have to use a technique
specific to the system you're using,
assuming
it provides one.
Since comp.lang.c is oriented towards those topics
that the C language has
defined support for,
you will usually get better answers to other questions by 
referring to a system-specific newsgroup
such as
comp.unix.questions


or
comp.os.msdos.programmer,

and to the FAQ lists for these groups.
Note that the answers


may differ even across variants
of otherwise similar systems
(e.g. across different variants of Unix);
bear in mind when answering system-specific questions that the
answer that applies to your system may not apply to everyone else's.
</p><p>


However, since these questions are
frequently asked here,
here
are
brief answers
for some
common
situations.
</p><p>
Depending on
which operating system you're using
and

what libraries you have available,
you may be able to use one
(or more!)
of the following techniques:
</p><UL><li>If you can use the ``curses'' library,
you can call <TT>cbreak</TT>
<a href="crmode.html" rel=subdocument>[footnote]</a>
(and perhaps <TT>noecho</TT>),
after which calls to <TT>getch</TT>
will return characters immediately.
<li>If all you're trying to do is
read a short password without echo,
you
may be able to
use a function called <TT>getpass</TT>,
if it's available.
(Another possibility for hiding typed passwords
is to select black characters on a black background.)
<li>Under
``classic''
versions of
Unix,
use <TT>ioctl</TT>
and the TIOCGETP and TIOCSETP
(or TIOCSETN) requests
on file descriptor 0
to manipulate
the
sgttyb structure,
defined in <TT>&lt;sgtty.h&gt;</TT>
and documented in tty(4).
In the <TT>sg_flags</TT> field,
set the CBREAK
(or RAW) bit,
and perhaps clear the ECHO bit.
<li>Under System V Unix,

use <TT>ioctl</TT>
and the TCGETAW and TCSETAW requests
on file descriptor 0
to manipulate
the
termio structure,
defined in <TT>&lt;termio.h&gt;</TT>.
In the <TT>c_lflag</TT> field,
clear the ICANON
(and perhaps ECHO)
bits.
Also,
set
<TT>c_cc[VMIN]</TT> to 1 and <TT>c_cc[VTIME]</TT> to 0.
<li>Under any operating system
(Unix or otherwise)
offering POSIX compatibility,
use the <TT>tcgetattr</TT> and <TT>tcsetattr</TT> calls
on file descriptor 0
to manipulate
the
termios structure,
defined in <TT>&lt;termios.h&gt;</TT>.
In the
<TT>c_lflag</TT> field,
clear the ICANON
(and perhaps ECHO)
bits.
Also,
set
<TT>c_cc[VMIN]</TT> to 1 and <TT>c_cc[VTIME]</TT> to 0.
<li>In a pinch,
under Unix,
use <TT>system</TT>
(see question <a href="system.html">19.27</a>)
to invoke the <TT>stty</TT> command
to set terminal driver
modes
(as in the preceding three items).
<li>Under
MS-DOS,
use <TT>getch</TT>
or <TT>getche</TT>,
or the corresponding
BIOS interrupts.
<li>Under VMS,
try the
Screen Management (SMG$) routines,
or curses,
or issue low-level $QIO's


with the IO$_READVBLK
function code
(and perhaps IO$M_NOECHO, and others)
to ask for one character at a time.
(It's also possible to set character-at-a-time
or ``pass through'' modes in the VMS terminal driver.)
<li>Under other operating systems, you're on your own.
</UL><p></p><p>(As an aside,
note that
simply
using <TT>setbuf</TT> or <TT>setvbuf</TT>
to set <TT>stdin</TT> to unbuffered

will <em>not</em> generally serve to allow character-at-a-time input.)
</p><p>


If you change terminal modes,
save
a copy
the initial state
and be sure to restore it no matter how your program terminates.
</p><p>If you're trying to write a portable program,
a good approach is to define your own suite of three functions to
(1)
set the
terminal driver
or
input system
into character-at-a-time mode
(if necessary),
(2)
get characters,
and
(3)
return the terminal driver
to its initial state
when the program is finished.
(Ideally, such a set of functions
might
be part of the C Standard, some day.)
</p><p>As an example,
here is a tiny test program
which prints the decimal values
of the next ten characters
as they are typed,
without waiting for RETURN.
It is
written in terms of three functions,
as described,
and is
followed by implementations of the three functions
for curses,
classic Unix,
System V Unix,
and MS-DOS.

(The on-line archives associated with this list
contain a
more complete set of functions.)
<pre>
#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;

main()
{
	int i;
	if(tty_break() != 0)
		return 1;
	for(i = 0; i &lt; 10; i++)
		printf(" = %d\n", tty_getchar());
	tty_fix();
	return 0;
}
</pre>
</p><p>This implementation
of the three functions
is for curses:
<pre>
#include &lt;curses.h&gt;

int tty_break()
{
	initscr();
	cbreak();
	return 0;
}

int tty_getchar()
{
	return getch();
}

int tty_fix()
{
	endwin();
	return 0;
}
</pre>
</p><p>Here is the code
for ``classic'' (V7, BSD) Unix:
<pre>
#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;
#include &lt;sgtty.h&gt;

static struct sgttyb savemodes;
static int havemodes = 0;

int tty_break()
{
	struct sgttyb modmodes;
	if(ioctl(fileno(stdin), TIOCGETP, &amp;savemodes) &lt; 0)
		return -1;
	havemodes = 1;
	modmodes = savemodes;
	modmodes.sg_flags |= CBREAK;
	return ioctl(fileno(stdin), TIOCSETN, &amp;modmodes);
}

int tty_getchar()
{
	return getchar();
}

int tty_fix()
{
	if(!havemodes)
		return 0;
	return ioctl(fileno(stdin), TIOCSETN, &amp;savemodes);
}
</pre>
</p><p>The code for System V Unix

is similar:
<pre>
#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;
#include &lt;termio.h&gt;

static struct termio savemodes;
static int havemodes = 0;

int tty_break()
{
	struct termio modmodes;
	if(ioctl(fileno(stdin), TCGETA, &amp;savemodes) &lt; 0)
		return -1;
	havemodes = 1;
	modmodes = savemodes;
	modmodes.c_lflag &amp;= ~ICANON;
	modmodes.c_cc[VMIN] = 1;
	modmodes.c_cc[VTIME] = 0;
	return ioctl(fileno(stdin), TCSETAW, &amp;modmodes);
}

int tty_getchar()
{
	return getchar();
}

int tty_fix()
{
	if(!havemodes)
		return 0;
	return ioctl(fileno(stdin), TCSETAW, &amp;savemodes);
}
</pre>
</p><p>Finally,
here is an
implementation for MS-DOS:

<pre>
int tty_break() { return 0; }

int tty_getchar()
{
	return getche();
}

int tty_fix() { return 0; }
</pre>
</p><p>Turning off echo
is left as an exercise for the reader.

terminal
(keyboard and screen)
I/O
programming,
see an FAQ list, book,
or documentation set specific to your operating system.
(Note that




there can be many more details to take care of,
e.g. special characters to disable
as well as
more mode bits to toggle,
than
were mentioned
above.)

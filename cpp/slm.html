<p>
<font face=Helvetica size=8 color=blue><b>Q:</b></font>
Here are
some cute preprocessor macros:
<pre>
	#define begin	{
	#define end	}
</pre>
With these,
I can write C code that looks more like Pascal.
What do y'all think?
</p><p><hr>
<p>
<font face=Helvetica size=8 color=blue><b>A:</b></font>
Use of macros like these,
though perhaps superficially attractive,
is generally discouraged;
in severe cases
the practice is called

``preprocessor abuse.''
</p><p>There is little to be gained
in


trying to redefine
the syntax of a language
to fit your own predilections,
or
to match some other language.
Your predilections are unlikely to be shared
by later readers or maintainers of the code,
and any simulation of another language
is most unlikely to be perfect
(so any alleged convenience or utility
will probably be outweighed
by the nuisance of remembering the
imperfections).
</p><p>As a general rule,
it's a good idea
if the use of
preprocessor macros
follows the syntax of the C language.
Macros without arguments should look like variables or other
identifiers;
macros with arguments should look like function calls.
Ask yourself:
``If I somehow presented this code to the compiler
without running it through the preprocessor,
how many
syntax errors would I get?''
(Of course, you'd get plenty of undefined
symbols
and non-constant array dimensions,
but those aren't <em>syntax</em> errors.)
This rule means that C code,
plus macro invocations,
still looks like C code.
So-called nonsyntactic macros

like <TT>begin</TT> and <TT>end</TT>
or <TT>CTRL(D)</TT>
(see question <a href="charize.html">10.21</a>)
can make C look like
gobbledygook
(see also question <a href="../misc/ioccc.html">20.36</a>).
</p><p>This is of course largely a style issue;
see
also
section
<a href="../style/index.html">17</a>.

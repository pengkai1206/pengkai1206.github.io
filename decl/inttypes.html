How should I decide which integer type to use?
</p><p><hr>
<p>
<font face=Helvetica size=8 color=blue><b>A:</b></font>
If you might need large values
(above 32,767 or below -32,767),
use <TT>long</TT>.
Otherwise,
if
space is very important
(i.e. if
there are large arrays or many structures),
use <TT>short</TT>.
Otherwise,

use <TT>int</TT>.
If well-defined overflow characteristics are important

and
negative values are not,
or if you want to
steer clear of

sign-extension problems when manipulating bits or bytes,
use
one of
the corresponding <TT>unsigned</TT> types.
(Beware
when
mixing signed and unsigned

values
in expressions,
though;
see question <a href="../expr/preservingrules.html">3.19</a>.)
</p><p>Although
character types
(especially <TT>unsigned&nbsp;char</TT>)
can

be used as
``tiny''
integers,
doing so is
sometimes
more trouble than it's worth.
The compiler will have to emit extra code
to convert between <TT>char</TT> and <TT>int</TT>
(making the executable larger),
and
unexpected sign extension can
be troublesome.
(Using <TT>unsigned&nbsp;char</TT> can help;
see question <a href="../stdio/getcharc.html">12.1</a> for a related problem.)
</p><p>A similar space/time tradeoff applies
when deciding between <TT>float</TT>
and <TT>double</TT>.
(Many compilers still convert all <TT>float</TT> values to 
<TT>double</TT>
during expression evaluation.)

None of the above rules
apply


if
pointers to the variable
must have a particular type.


</p><p>Variables referring to certain kinds of data,
such as sizes of objects in memory,
can and should use predefined abstract types
such as <TT>size_t</TT>.

</p><p>It's often
incorrectly
assumed that C's types are defined to have certain, exact sizes.
In fact,
what's guaranteed is that:
<UL><li>type <TT>char</TT> can hold values up to 127;
<li>types <TT>short int</TT> and <TT>int</TT> can hold values up to 32,767;
and
<li>type <TT>long int</TT> can hold values up to 2,147,483,647.

<li>something like
the relation
<pre>
	sizeof(char) &lt;= sizeof(short) &lt;= sizeof(int) &lt;= sizeof(long) &lt;= sizeof(long long)
</pre>
holds.
<a href="fn1.html" rel=subdocument>[footnote]</a>
</UL></p><p>From these values, it can be inferred that <TT>char</TT> is at 
least 8 bits,
<TT>short int</TT> and <TT>int</TT> are at least 16 bits,
and <TT>long int</TT> is at least 32 bits.
(The signed and unsigned versions of each type
are guaranteed to have the same size.)
Under ANSI C,
the maximum and minimum values 
for a particular machine
can be found in the header file <TT>&lt;limits.h&gt;</TT>;
here is a summary:
<table><tr><td>Base type</td><td>Minimum size (bits)</td><td>Minimum value (signed)</td><td>Maximum value (signed)</td><td>Maximum value (unsigned)</td></tr>
<tr><td><TT>char</TT></td><td>8</td><td>-127</td><td>127</td><td>255</td></tr>
<tr><td><TT>short</TT></td><td>16</td><td>-32,767</td><td>32,767</td><td>65,535</td></tr>
<tr><td><TT>int</TT></td><td>16</td><td>-32,767</td><td>32,767</td><td>65,535</td></tr>
<tr><td><TT>long</TT></td><td>32</td><td>-2,147,483,647</td><td>2,147,483,647</td><td>4,294,967,295</td></tr>
</table>(These values are the minimums guaranteed by the Standard.
Many implementations allow larger values,
but portable programs shouldn't depend on it.)
</p><p>If for some reason you need to declare something with an
exact
size
(usually the only good reason for doing so
is when attempting to conform
to some externally-imposed storage layout,
but see question
<a href="../misc/binaryfiles.html">20.5</a>),
be sure to encapsulate the choice
behind an appropriate typedef,
but see question <a href="int16.html">1.3</a>.
</p><p>If you need to manipulate huge values,
larger than the guaranteed range of C's built-in types,
you need an arbitrary-precision
(or ``multiple precision'')
arithmetic library;
see question <a href="../resources/mplib.html">18.15d</a>.

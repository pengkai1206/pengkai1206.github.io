<H1>About the C FAQ List</H1>
<p>
This is the HTML version of the comp.lang.c FAQ list.
This FAQ list was first composed in 1990,
for posting to the Usenet newsgroup comp.lang.c.
It has undergone episodic refinement ever since,
including being published as a <a href="book/index.html">book</a>.
<p>
More information about this list's history and purpose
is in the
<a href="usenetintro.html">introduction to the version posted to Usenet</a>,
the <a href="index.html">introduction to the HTML version</a>,
and the <a href="book/preface.html">preface</a>
and <a href="book/intro.html">introduction</a>
to the book version.

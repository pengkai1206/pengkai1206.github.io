How can I determine
which identifiers are safe for me to use
and which are reserved?
</p><p><hr>
<p>
<font face=Helvetica size=8 color=blue><b>A:</b></font>
Namespace management can be a sticky issue.
The problem--which isn't always
obvious--is that you don't want
to pick identifiers already in use by the implementation,

such that
you
get
``multiply defined'' errors
or--even worse--quietly
replace
one of the implementation's 
symbols
and
break
everything.
You also want some guarantee that later releases

won't usurp names
you're legitimately using.
<a href="internal.html" rel=subdocument>[footnote]</a>
(Few things are more frustrating
than taking a debugged, working, production program,
recompiling it under a new release of a compiler,
and having the build fail
due to namespace or other problems.)
Therefore,
the ANSI/ISO C Standard contains rather elaborate definitions
carving out distinct namespace subsets
for the user and the implementation.
</p><p>To make sense of ANSI's rules,
and
before we can say whether a given identifier is reserved,
we must understand three attributes of

the identifier:
its scope, namespace, and linkage.
</p><p>There are four kinds of scope
(regions over which an
identifier's declaration is in effect)
in C:

function,
file,
block,
and
prototype.
(The fourth
one

exists only in the parameter lists
of function prototype declarations;
see also question <a href="../ansi/structinproto.html">11.5</a>.)
</p><p>There are four different kinds of namespaces,
for:

<UL><li>labels
(i.e. <TT>goto</TT> targets);
<li>tags
(names of structures, unions,
and

enumerations;
these
three
aren't separate even though they theoretically could be);
<li>structure/union members
(one namespace per structure or union);
and
<li>everything else
(functions, variables, typedef names, enumeration constants),
termed ``ordinary identifiers'' by the Standard.
</UL></p><p>Another set of names
(though not termed a ``namespace'' by the Standard)
consists of preprocessor macros;
these are all expanded
before the compiler gets around to considering the four formal namespaces.
</p><p>The standard defines three kinds of ``linkage'':

external, internal, and none.
For our purposes,
external linkage means global,
non-<TT>static</TT> variables and functions
(across all source files),
internal linkage means <TT>static</TT> variables and functions
with file scope,
and
``no linkage''
refers to local variables,
and also things like typedef names and enumeration constants.

</p><p>The rules,
paraphrased from
ANSI Sec. 4.1.2.1,
are:
</p><UL><li>1.
All
identifiers beginning with an underscore
followed by an upper-case letter or another underscore
are always reserved
(all scopes, all namespaces).
<li>2.
All
identifiers beginning with an underscore
are reserved for ordinary identifiers
(functions, variables, typedefs, enumeration constants)
with file scope.

<li>3.
A
macro name defined in a standard header
is reserved for any use
if


any
header which <TT>#define</TT>s it is <TT>#include</TT>d.
<li>4.
All
standard library identifiers
with external linkage
(e.g. function names)
are always reserved
as identifiers with external linkage.
<li>5.
Typedef

and
tag names,
with file scope,
defined in standard headers,
are reserved at file scope
(in the same namespace)
if the corresponding header is <TT>#include</TT>d.
(The Standard really says
``each identifier with file scope,''
but the only standard identifiers not covered by rule 4
are typedef and tag names.)
</UL><p>Rules 3 and 4
are additionally complicated by the fact that
several sets of macro names and standard library identifiers
are reserved for ``future directions''
that is,
later revisions of the Standard
may define new names matching certain patterns.
</p><p>Here is a list of the patterns which are reserved for 
``future directions''
associared with each standard header:
<blockquote>[TABLE GOES HERE]
</blockquote>(The notation <TT>[A-Z]</TT> means ``any uppercase letter'';
similarly, <TT>[a-z]</TT> and <TT>[0-9]</TT> indicate lower-case 
letters and digits.
The notation <TT>*</TT> means ``anything.''
For example,
the pattern for <TT>&lt;stdlib.h&gt;</TT> says that
all external identifiers beginning with the letters <TT>str</TT>
followed by a lower-case letter
are reserved.)
</p><p>What do the
above
rules really mean?
If you want to be on the safe side:
</p><UL><li>1,2.
Don't
give anything a name
with a leading underscore.
<li>3.
Don't
give anything a name
which is already a
standard macro
(including the ``future directions'' patterns).
<li>4.
Don't
give
any functions or global variables
names
which are already taken by
functions or variables in the standard library,
or
which match
any of the ``future directions'' patterns.
(Strictly speaking, ``matching'' means
matching in the first six characters,
without regard to case;
see question <a href="../ansi/extidsignif.html">11.27</a>.)
<li>5.
Don't redefine standard typedef

or tag names.
</UL><p>In fact,
the preceding
subparagraphs

are overly conservative.
If you wish,
you may

remember the following exceptions:
</p><UL><li>1,2.
You may use identifiers consisting of
an underscore
followed by a digit or lower case letter
for labels and structure/union members.
<li>1,2.
You may use identifiers consisting of
an underscore
followed by a digit or lower case letter
at function, block, or prototype scope.
<li>3.
You may use names matching standard macro names
if you don't <TT>#include</TT> any header files which <TT>#define</TT> them.
<li>4.
You may use names of standard library routines as static or 
local variables
(strictly speaking, as identifiers with internal or no linkage).
<li>5.
You may use standard typedef and tag names
if you don't <TT>#include</TT> any header files which declare them.
</UL><p>However,
before making use of any of these exceptions,
recognize that
some of them are pretty risky
(especially exceptions 3 and 5,
since
you could
accidentally <TT>#include</TT> the relevant header file
at a later time,
perhaps through a chain of nested <TT>#include</TT> files),
and others
(especially the ones labeled 1,2)
represent sort of a ``no man's land''

between the user namespaces
and the namespaces reserved to the implementation.
</p><p>One reason for providing these exceptions
is to allow the implementors
of various add-in libraries
a way to declare
their own
internal or
``hidden'' identifiers.
If you make use of any of the exceptions,
you won't clash with any identifiers defined by the Standard,
but you might clash with something
defined by a third-party library you're using.
(If,
on the other hand,
you're
the one who's

implementing an add-on library,
you're welcome to make use of them,
if necessary,
and if you're careful.)
</p><p>
(It <em>is</em>

generally safe to make use of exception 4
to give function parameters
or local variables
names matching standard library routines

or ``future directions'' patterns.
For example,
``<TT>string</TT>''
is a
common--and legal--name
for a
parameter or local variable.)

Why can't I pass a <TT>char&nbsp;**</TT> to a function which expects a
<TT>const&nbsp;char&nbsp;**</TT>?
</p><p><hr>

You can use a pointer-to-T (for any type T) where a
pointer-to-const-T is expected.
However,
the
rule
(an explicit exception)
which permits slight mismatches
in qualified pointer
types
is not applied recursively,
but only at the top level.
(<TT>const&nbsp;char&nbsp;**</TT> is
pointer-to-pointer-to-const-char,
and the exception

therefore does not apply.)
</p><p>The reason that you cannot assign a
<TT>char&nbsp;**</TT> value to a <TT>const&nbsp;char&nbsp;**</TT>
pointer is somewhat obscure.
Given that the <TT>const</TT> qualifier exists at all,
the compiler would like to help you keep your promises not to 
modify <TT>const</TT> values.
That's why you can assign
a <TT>char&nbsp;*</TT> to a <TT>const&nbsp;char&nbsp;*</TT>,
but not the other way around:
it's clearly safe to ``add'' <TT>const</TT>-ness to a simple pointer,
but it would be dangerous to take it away.
However, suppose you performed the following

more complicated
series of
assignments:
<pre>
	const char c = 'x';		/* 1 */
	char *p1;			/* 2 */
	const char **p2 = &amp;p1;		/* 3 */
	*p2 = &amp;c;			/* 4 */
	*p1 = 'X';			/* 5 */
</pre>
In line 3,
we assign a <TT>char&nbsp;**</TT> to a <TT>const&nbsp;char&nbsp;**</TT>.
(The compiler should complain.)
In line 4,
we assign a <TT>const&nbsp;char&nbsp;*</TT> to a <TT>const&nbsp;char&nbsp;*</TT>;
this is clearly legal.
In line 5,
we modify what a <TT>char&nbsp;*</TT> points to--this is supposed to be legal.
However, <TT>p1</TT> ends up pointing to <TT>c</TT>,
which is <TT>const</TT>.
This came about in line 4,
because <TT>*p2</TT> was really <TT>p1</TT>.
This was set up in line 3,
which is an assignment of a form that is disallowed,
and this is exactly <em>why</em> line 3 is disallowed.
</p><p>Assigning a <TT>char&nbsp;**</TT> to a <TT>const&nbsp;char&nbsp;**</TT>
(as in line 3, and in the original question)
is not immediately dangerous.
But it sets up a situation in which <TT>p2</TT>'s promise--that
the ultimately-pointed-to value won't be modified--cannot
be kept.
</p><p>(C++
has more complicated rules
for assigning <TT>const</TT>-qualified pointers
which let you make more kinds of assignments
without incurring warnings,
but still protect against inadvertent attempts
to modify <TT>const</TT> values.
C++ would still not allow
assigning a <TT>char&nbsp;**</TT> to a <TT>const&nbsp;char&nbsp;**</TT>,
but it would let you get away with
assigning a <TT>char&nbsp;**</TT>
to a <TT>const&nbsp;char&nbsp;*&nbsp;const&nbsp;*</TT>.)
</p><p>In C,
if
you must
assign or pass
pointers which have qualifier mismatches at
other than the first level of indirection,
you
must use explicit casts
(e.g. <TT>(const&nbsp;char&nbsp;**)</TT> in this case),
although as always,
the need for such a cast may indicate a deeper problem
which the cast doesn't really fix.

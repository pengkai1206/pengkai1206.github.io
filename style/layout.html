What's the best style for code layout in C?

</p><p><hr>
<p>
<font face=Helvetica size=8 color=blue><b>A:</b></font>
Kernighan and Ritchie,
while providing the example most often copied,
also supply a good excuse for
disregarding
it:
<blockquote>The position of braces is less important,
although people hold passionate beliefs.
We have chosen one of several popular styles.
Pick a style that suits you,
then use it consistently.
</blockquote></p><p>It is more important that the layout chosen be consistent
(with itself, and with nearby or common code)
than that it be ``perfect.''
If your coding environment (i.e. local custom or company policy)
does not suggest a style,
and you don't feel like inventing

your own,
just copy K&amp;R.
</p><p>

Each of the various popular styles has its


good

and bad
points.
Putting the
open brace

on a line by itself wastes

vertical space;
combining it with the following line makes it hard to edit; combining it
with the previous line prevents it from lining up with the close brace
and may make it harder to see.
</p><p>Indenting by eight columns per level is most common,
but often gets you
uncomfortably close to the right margin
(which may be a hint that you should

break up the function).
If you indent by one tab but set

tabstops at
something other
than eight columns,

you're requiring other
people to read your code with the same software setup that you used.
(See also the Indian Hill Style Guide.)
</p><p>The elusive quality of ``good style'' involves much more
than mere code layout details;
don't spend time on formatting to the exclusion of
more substantive code quality issues.

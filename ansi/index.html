<H1>11. ANSI/ISO Standard C</H1>

<p><a href="ansi1.html" rel=subdocument>11.1</a>
What is the ``ANSI C Standard?''
</p><p><a href="avail.html" rel=subdocument>11.2</a>
How can I get a copy of the Standard?
</p><p><a href="updates.html" rel=subdocument>11.2b</a>
Where can I get information about updates to the Standard?
</p><p><a href="argpromos.html" rel=subdocument>11.3</a>
My ANSI compiler
complains about a mismatch when it sees
<pre>
	extern int func(float);

	int func(x)
	float x;
	{ ...
</pre>
</p><p><a href="mixoldandnew.html" rel=subdocument>11.4</a>
Can you mix old-style and new-style
function syntax?
</p><p><a href="structinproto.html" rel=subdocument>11.5</a>
Why does the declaration
<pre>
extern int f(struct x *p);</pre>

give me
an obscure
warning message
about
``struct x declared inside parameter list''?
</p><p><a href="varargproto.html" rel=subdocument>11.6</a>
I had a frustrating problem which turned out to be caused by the line
<pre>
	printf("%d", n);
</pre>
where <TT>n</TT> was actually a <TT>long&nbsp;int</TT>.
I thought that ANSI function prototypes
were supposed to guard against argument type mismatches like this.

</p><p><a href="varargproto2.html" rel=subdocument>11.7</a>
I heard that you have to <TT>#include</TT> <TT>&lt;stdio.h&gt;</TT>
before calling <TT>printf</TT>.
Why?

</p><p><a href="constasconst.html" rel=subdocument>11.8</a>
I don't understand why I can't
use <TT>const</TT> values in initializers and array
dimensions,
as in
<pre>
	const int n = 5;
	int a[n];
</pre>
</p><p><a href="strlitnotconst.html" rel=subdocument>11.8b</a>
If you can't modify string literals,
why aren't they defined as being
arrays of <TT>const</TT> characters?
</p><p><a href="constptrconst.html" rel=subdocument>11.9</a>
What's the difference between
<TT>const&nbsp;char&nbsp;*p</TT>,
<TT>char&nbsp;const&nbsp;*p</TT>,
and <TT>char&nbsp;*&nbsp;const&nbsp;p</TT>?
</p><p><a href="constmismatch.html" rel=subdocument>11.10</a>



Why can't I pass a <TT>char&nbsp;**</TT> to a function which expects a
<TT>const&nbsp;char&nbsp;**</TT>?
</p><p><a href="typedefconst.html" rel=subdocument>11.11</a>
I've got
the declarations
<pre>
	typedef char *charp;
	const charp p;
</pre>
Why is <TT>p</TT> turning out <TT>const</TT>,
instead of the characters pointed to?
</p><p><a href="constvsdefine2.html" rel=subdocument>11.11b</a>
What's the difference between
<pre>
	const MAXSIZE = 100;
</pre>
<pre>
and
</pre>
<pre>
	#define MAXSIZE 100
</pre>

</p><p><a href="maindecl.html" rel=subdocument>11.12a</a>
What's the correct declaration of <TT>main()</TT>?
</p><p><a href="voidmain.html" rel=subdocument>11.12b</a>

Can I declare <TT>main</TT> as <TT>void</TT>,
to shut off these annoying
``main returns no value'' messages?
</p><p><a href="envp.html" rel=subdocument>11.13</a>
But what about <TT>main</TT>'s third argument,
<TT>envp</TT>?
</p><p><a href="voidmain3.html" rel=subdocument>11.14a</a>
I believe that declaring <TT>void&nbsp;main()</TT> can't fail,
since I'm calling <TT>exit</TT> instead of returning,
and anyway my operating system ignores a program's exit/return status.
</p><p><a href="voidmainexamp.html" rel=subdocument>11.14b</a>
So what could go wrong?
Are there
really any
systems where <TT>void&nbsp;main()</TT> doesn't work?
</p><p><a href="voidmainbooks.html" rel=subdocument>11.15</a>
The book I've been using,
<I>C Programing
for the Compleat Idiot</I>,
always uses <TT>void&nbsp;main()</TT>.
</p><p><a href="exitvsreturn.html" rel=subdocument>11.16</a>
Is <TT>exit(status)</TT> truly equivalent
to returning the same <TT>status</TT> from <TT>main</TT>?
</p><p><a href="stringize.html" rel=subdocument>11.17</a>
I'm trying to use
the ANSI ``stringizing'' preprocessing operator
`<TT>#</TT>'
to insert the value of a symbolic constant into a message,
but it keeps
stringizing the macro's name rather than its
value.
</p><p><a href="macstrexp.html" rel=subdocument>11.18</a>
What does the message
``warning: macro replacement within a string literal''
mean?
</p><p><a href="ifdefsyntax.html" rel=subdocument>11.19</a>
I'm getting strange syntax errors inside
lines
I've
<TT>#ifdef</TT>fed out.
</p><p><a href="pragma.html" rel=subdocument>11.20</a>
What are <TT>#pragma</TT>s 
and what are they good for?
</p><p><a href="pragmaonce.html" rel=subdocument>11.21</a>
What does ``<TT>#pragma&nbsp;once</TT>'' mean?
I found it in some header files.
</p><p><a href="nonstrings.html" rel=subdocument>11.22</a>
Is <TT>char&nbsp;a[3]&nbsp;=&nbsp;"abc";</TT> legal?
What does it mean?
</p><p><a href="aryvsadr.html" rel=subdocument>11.23</a>
Since array references decay into pointers,
if <TT>arr</TT> is an array,
what's
the difference between
<TT>arr</TT> and <TT>&amp;arr</TT>?

</p><p><a href="voidparith.html" rel=subdocument>11.24</a>
Why can't I perform arithmetic on a <TT>void&nbsp;*</TT> pointer?
</p><p><a href="memmove.html" rel=subdocument>11.25</a>
What's the difference between
<TT>memcpy</TT> and
<TT>memmove</TT>?

</p><p><a href="malloc0.html" rel=subdocument>11.26</a>
What should <TT>malloc(0)</TT> do?
Return a null pointer or a pointer to 0 bytes?
</p><p><a href="extidsignif.html" rel=subdocument>11.27</a>
Why does the ANSI Standard
place limits on
the length
and case-significance
of

external identifiers?
</p><p><a href="noalias.html" rel=subdocument>11.28</a>
What was <TT>noalias</TT> and what ever happened to it?
</p><p><a href="preansi.html" rel=subdocument>11.29a</a>
My compiler is rejecting the simplest possible test programs,
with all kinds of syntax errors.
It's complaining about the
first line of
<pre>
	main(int argc, char **argv)
	{
		return 0;
	}
</pre>
</p><p><a href="preansi2.html" rel=subdocument>11.29b</a>
What does the message

``Automatic aggregate intialization is an ANSI feature''
mean?
My compiler is complaining about valid ANSI code.
</p><p><a href="preansilib.html" rel=subdocument>11.30</a>
Why are some ANSI/ISO Standard library functions showing up as
undefined, even though I've got an ANSI compiler?
</p><p><a href="cproto.html" rel=subdocument>11.31</a>
Does anyone have a tool for converting old-style C programs to
ANSI C,
or vice versa,
or for automatically generating prototypes?
</p><p><a href="extensions.html" rel=subdocument>11.32</a>
Why won't
the Frobozz Magic C Compiler,
which claims to be ANSI compliant,
accept this code?
I know that the code is ANSI, because <TT>gcc</TT> accepts it.
</p><p><a href="undef.html" rel=subdocument>11.33</a>
People seem to make a point of distinguishing
between
implementation-defined,
unspecified,
and
undefined
behavior.
What do these mean?
</p><p><a href="compliance.html" rel=subdocument>11.33b</a>
What does it really mean for a program to be
``legal''
or
``valid''
or
``conforming''?
</p><p><a href="appalled.html" rel=subdocument>11.34</a>
I'm appalled that the ANSI Standard leaves so many issues undefined.
Isn't a Standard's whole job to standardize these things?
</p><p><a href="experiment.html" rel=subdocument>11.35</a>
People keep saying that the behavior
of <TT>i&nbsp;=&nbsp;i++</TT>
is undefined,
but
I just tried
it
on an ANSI-conforming compiler,
and got the results I expected.

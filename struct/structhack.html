<font face=Helvetica size=8 color=blue><b>Q:</b></font>
I came across some code that declared a structure
like this:
<pre>
struct name {
	int namelen;
	char namestr[1];
};
</pre>
and then did some tricky allocation to make
the
<TT>namestr</TT>
array act like it
had several elements,
with the number
recorded by <TT>namelen</TT>.
How does this work?
Is
it
legal or portable?
</p><p><hr>
<p>
<font face=Helvetica size=8 color=blue><b>A:</b></font>
It's not clear if it's legal or portable,
but it is rather popular.
An implementation of the technique
might look
something like this:
<pre>
#include &lt;stdlib.h&gt;
#include &lt;string.h&gt;

struct name *makename(char *newname)
{
	struct name *ret =
		malloc(sizeof(struct name)-1 + strlen(newname)+1);
				/* -1 for initial [1]; +1 for \0 */
	if(ret != NULL) {
		ret-&gt;namelen = strlen(newname);
		strcpy(ret-&gt;namestr, newname);
	}

	return ret;
}
</pre>
This function allocates
an instance of the <TT>name</TT> structure
with the size adjusted
so that the <TT>namestr</TT> field can hold the requested name
(not just one character,
as the structure declaration would suggest).
</p><p>Despite its popularity,

the technique is also somewhat notorious:
Dennis Ritchie has called it
``unwarranted chumminess with the


C implementation,''
and an
official interpretation

has deemed that it
is not
strictly conforming
with the C Standard,
although
it does seem to work under
all known implementations.
(Compilers which check array bounds carefully
might issue warnings.)
</p><p>Another possibility is
to declare the variable-size element very
large, rather than very small.
The
above example
could be rewritten like this:
<pre>
#include &lt;stdlib.h&gt;
#include &lt;string.h&gt;

#define MAXSIZE 100

struct name {
	int namelen;
	char namestr[MAXSIZE];
};

struct name *makename(char *newname)
{
	struct name *ret =
		malloc(sizeof(struct name)-MAXSIZE+strlen(newname)+1);
								/* +1 for \0 */
	if(ret != NULL) {
		ret-&gt;namelen = strlen(newname);
		strcpy(ret-&gt;namestr, newname);
	}

	return ret;
}
</pre>
where <TT>MAXSIZE</TT> is larger than any name which will be stored.
However,
it looks like this technique is disallowed by
a strict interpretation of the Standard
as well.
Furthermore,
either of these ``chummy'' structures must be used with care,
since the programmer knows more about their size than the compiler does.
</p><p>Of course, to be truly safe,
the right thing to do is use a character pointer instead of an array:
<pre>
#include &lt;stdlib.h&gt;
#include &lt;string.h&gt;

struct name {
	int namelen;
	char *namep;
};

struct name *makename(char *newname)
{
	struct name *ret = malloc(sizeof(struct name));
	if(ret != NULL) {
		ret-&gt;namelen = strlen(newname);
		ret-&gt;namep = malloc(ret-&gt;namelen + 1);
		if(ret-&gt;namep == NULL) {
			free(ret);
			return NULL;
		}
		strcpy(ret-&gt;namep, newname);
	}

	return ret;
}
</pre>
(Obviously, the ``convenience'' of having
the length and the string stored in the same block of memory
has now been lost,
and freeing instances of this structure will require two calls to <TT>free</TT>;
see question <a href="../malloc/freeforall.html">7.23</a>.)
</p><p>When the data type being stored is characters,
as in the above examples,
it is straightforward to coalesce the two calls to 
<TT>malloc</TT> into one,
to preserve contiguity
(and therefore rescue the ability to use a single call to <TT>free</TT>):
<pre>
struct name *makename(char *newname)
{
	char *buf = malloc(sizeof(struct name) +
				strlen(newname) + 1);
	struct name *ret = (struct name *)buf;
	ret-&gt;namelen = strlen(newname);
	ret-&gt;namep = buf + sizeof(struct name);
	strcpy(ret-&gt;namep, newname);

	return ret;
}
</pre>
</p><p>However,
piggybacking a second region
onto a single <TT>malloc</TT> call
like this
is only portable
if the second region is to be treated as an array of <TT>char</TT>.
For any larger type,
alignment
(see questions <a href="padding.html">2.12</a> and <a href="../strangeprob/ptralign.html">16.7</a>)
becomes significant and would have to be preserved.
</p><p>C99 introduces
the concept of a <a href="../sx1/index.html#flexible array member"><dfn>flexible array member</dfn></a>,
which allows
the size of an array to be omitted if it 
is the last member in a structure,
thus
providing a well-defined solution.

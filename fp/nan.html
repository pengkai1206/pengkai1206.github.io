<p>
<font face=Helvetica size=8 color=blue><b>Q:</b></font>
How do I
set variables to, or
test for
IEEE NaN
(``Not a Number'')
and other special values?
</p><p><hr>
<p>
<font face=Helvetica size=8 color=blue><b>A:</b></font>
Many systems

with high-quality IEEE floating-point implementations provide
facilities
(e.g.
predefined constants,
and functions
like
<TT>isnan()</TT>,
either
as nonstandard extensions
in <TT>&lt;math.h&gt;</TT>
or perhaps
in
<TT>&lt;ieee.h&gt;</TT>
or
<TT>&lt;nan.h&gt;</TT>)

to deal with these values cleanly,
and
work is being done
to formally standardize such facilities.
A crude but usually effective test for NaN
can be written based on the fact that IEEE NaN's
never compare equal to anything,
even themselves;
therefore
a number that doesn't compare equal to itself
must be a NaN:
<pre>
	#define isnan(x) ((x) != (x))
</pre>
Beware, though, that
non-IEEE-aware compilers may
optimize the test away.
(Note also that
even if you do have a predefined constant like <TT>NAN</TT>,
you <em>cannot</em> use it in comparisons like 
<TT>if(x&nbsp;==&nbsp;NAN)</TT>,
again because
NaN's do not compare equal to themselves.)
</p><p>C99 provides
<TT>isnan()</TT>,
<TT>fpclassify()</TT>,
and several other classification routines.
</p><p>Another
possibility
is
to format
the value in question
using
<TT>sprintf</TT>:
on
many systems
it

generates
strings like <TT>"NaN"</TT> and <TT>"Inf"</TT>
which you could compare for

in a pinch.

</p><p>To initialize variables with these values
(and if your system does not provide cleaner solutions),
you may be able to get away with some compile-time
``arithmetic'':
<pre>
	double nan = 0./0.;
	double inf = 1./0.;
</pre>
Don't be too
surprised,
though,
if these don't work
(or if they abort the compiler with a floating-point exception).
</p><p>(The most reliable way of setting up these special values
would use a hex representation of their internal bit patterns,
but initializing a floating-point value with a bit pattern
would require using a union or some other type punning mechanism
and
would obviously be
machine-dependent.)

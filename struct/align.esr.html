I'm working this up for Steve Summit's C-FAQ.  Criticisms invited.
Cross-posted to comp.arch because it makes some assertions about standard alignment
conditions on various architectures.  All corrections cheerfully accepted.

Q: What is ``alignment'', and how does it affect the layout of my compound C
types?
<p>
A: Under most compilers on older word-oriented machines, each C data item
other than a component of a <TT>char</TT> array must begin on a byte address that
is a multiple of the word size of the machine (that is, each type must be
``word-aligned'').  Such implementations are becoming rare as ancient 16-
and 36-bit machines pass away.
<p>
On modern 32-bit machines like the SPARC or the Intel [34]86, or any
Motorola chip from the 68020 up, each data iten must usually be
``self-aligned'', beginning on an address that is a multiple of its type size.
Thus, 32-bit types must begin on a 32-bit boundary, 16-bit types on a 16-bit
boundary, 8-bit types may begin anywhere, struct/array/union types have the
alignment of their most restrictive member.  The first member of each
continuous group of bit fields is typically word-aligned, with all following
being continuously packed into following words (though ANSI C requires the
latter only for bit-field groups of less than word size).
<p>
These rules are consequences of the use your compiler gets out of the
machine's native addressing modes.  Eliminating alignment requirements
would often slow down memory access by requiring the generation of code to
do field accesses across word boundaries, or from odd addresses that are
slower to access.  A few compilers make it possible to force this with a
pragma, non-default compiler option or directive that says ``optimize for
space''.  Using this is almost never a good idea, unless you are required
to match an externally-defined layout and but are also sure you will not
be bitten by big-endian vs. little-endian incompatibilities, etc.
<p>
Q: How do I figure the ``true size'' (with trailing padding) of a type when
it occurs in a struct or array?
<p>
A: By rounding up its apparent size to a multiple of its alignment.  What
makes the general case tricky is that this rule has to be applied to
each element of a struct or array in turn, in order to count internal
padding; and when a struct or array has struct or array elements, the
rule must be applied recursively.
<p>
Under the ``self-aligned'' requirement, the true size of any scalar type
is the same as its apparent size.  The compound cases are most easily
understood by example (assume a 32-bit architecture with normal C sizes
of long=4, int=4, short=2, and char=1 on all these unless otherwise
specified).
<p>
(1) <TT>struct {char&nbsp;*; long;}</TT> has no trailing padding and is (4 + 4) = 8 bytes
long, or (8 + 8) = 16 with no padding on a 64-bit architecture.  But (2)
<TT>struct {char&nbsp;*; short;}</TT> will also be two machine words long, even though
a <TT>short</TT> is only a half-word, because the leading <TT>char&nbsp;*</TT> would force word
alignment on a following instance.  Accordingly, (3) <TT>struct {char&nbsp;*;
short; short;}</TT> will be the same two-word size as example 2; the final <TT>short</TT>
simply takes up what would have been padding.
<p>
(4) <TT>struct {char&nbsp;*; short; long;}</TT> will have a half-word of padding after
the <TT>short</TT> because <TT>long</TT> has to be word-aligned, and is thus the same size as 
<TT>struct {char&nbsp;*; short; short; long;}</TT>.  (5) <TT>struct {short; char;}</TT> would
have one byte of trailing padding; (6) <TT>struct {short; char; char;}</TT> would
be the same size as example 5, but with no padding.  On the other hand,
(7) <TT>struct {long; char;}</TT> would have 3 bytes of trailing padding, and
(8) <TT>struct {long; char; short}</TT> would have 1 byte of padding after the
<TT>char</TT>, be the same size as example 7, and have no trailing padding. 
<p>
Q: How can I squeeze the padding out of a structure to make it smaller?
<p>
A: On older, rigidly word-oriented architectures it may require drastic
measures (see below).
A simple rule that minimize padding in the ``self-aligned'' case (and does
no harm in most others) is to order your struct members by decreasing size.
On 16-bit machines and older word-oriented and 36-bit machines you need to
find out how long pointers are explicity; they may differ in size from 
scalar types due to memory-model complexity or odd char-pointer formats. 
No padding will be required within groups of members of the same size, and
no group will require leading padding; the only place you can lose is at the
end of the structure.
<p>
The above rule assumes your members are all normal scalar or pointer types,
and so have decreasing sizes of 8, 4, 2, and 1.  If your members are bit
fields, structs, arrays or unions, life becomes a little more complicated.
You need to think in terms of the ``true size'' of a member (see above), which
may not be a power of two.  Order your members by decreasing true size, then
pick members from the end to move to after each non-scalar type to fill the
trailing padding of the last component.  In the most common case, you'll
want to follow 17-to-24-bit members (like an 18-bit bitfield, 3-byte array,
or <TT>struct {short x; char y}</TT>) with a <TT>char</TT> rather than a <TT>short</TT>.
<p>
As a very drastic measure, you can declare all members as bit-fields (see
&lt;forward-reference to next question&gt;).  
<p>
However, you should think twice before taking even the first measure,
because the space gains tend to be very marginal unless your struct is
repeated thousands of times in an array or disk file.  Your time would
probably be better spent space-tuning the algorithm or representation you
are using.
<p>
Q: How can I get complete control of the bit-level layout of a struct?
<p>
A: This is what bit-fields are for.  Declare all your members as bit fields.
The structure may still have invisible trailing padding (unless your last
bit field exactly fills to the end of the last machine word), but on modern
architectures this will eliminate all other padding and give you complete
control of the bit layout of the declared parts (albeit at a significant
cost in access time).  However, ANSI does <em>not</em> guarantee this
well-behavedness, so look out for snags.
<p>
Note about bit fields: though modern compilers default them to unsigned,
ANSI does not require this, leading to some potentially surprising behavior
in the case of a 1-bit field with no signedness declaration.
<p>
On some poorly-implemented C compilers on very old 36-bit word-oriented
architectures, even this may not be enough; a bit field that runs over
the end of a word boundary may force the next bit field to start at the
beginning of the following word, leaving an invisible gap of up to 35 bits.
On these machines, your only option is to declare the struct as a single
char array and do the field accesses yourself in C.
<p>
See K&amp;R II, A8.3, page 213.
<p>
Q: Why can't I pass structs back and forth between the heterogenous machines
on my network?  It's all C, isn't it?
<p>
A: First, you'd have to be sure that all your machine/compiler combinations
have identical scalar type sizes.  If they're all 32-bit machines, this is
likely, with the sizes being long=4, int=4, short=2.  Even this is not 
certain, however -- some 680x0 compilers use 2-byte ints for faster 
arithmetic code.  If any of your boxes are (64-bit) DEC Alphas or (16-bit)
286 machines, forget it.
<p>
Then, you have to be sure you won't be nailed by big-endian vs.
little-endian incompatibilities.  And, in many applications,
floating-point-format incompatibilities.  And perhaps, character signedness.
<p>
Then, you have to be sure that all your compilers have the same alignment
and struct-padding requirements.  This is hard, because they are usually 
not documented.  In fact, this is usually the show-stopper.
<p>
To pass structure data over a network, you will typically need a tool
like ASN.1 or SUN RPC.
<p>

<p>
And a free extra answer:
<p>
Q: I came to C from Pascal, and the one feature I miss is Pascal's `with'
construct.  Shouldn't C have an equivalent?
<p>
A: No, it's too dangerous.  Let's give `with' the obvious syntax and look at an
example:
<pre>
   struct symbol
   {
       char *name;
       int  class;
   };

   struct symbol mysym;
   int value = 17;

   with mysym
   {
      name = "sample"
      class = value;
   }

   if (value != 17)
	die_horribly();
</pre>
<p>
So far, so good.  But now, suppose the struct symbol definition lives in
an <TT>#include</TT> file far from this use --- and someone adds a `value' member
there without noticing the `with'.  The meaning of the `value' reference
would suddenly and silently change, making the final value of `class'
random and probably causing the above code to die horribly.

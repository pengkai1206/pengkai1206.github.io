[Someone once asked me if after calling
<pre>
	p = malloc(strlen(string));
</pre>
the call
<pre>
	strcpy(p, string);
</pre>
should succeed or fail.
They suspected that the <TT>strcpy</TT> call should fail,
because space for the terminating <TT>\0</TT> was not allocated.
They suspected that the pointer <TT>p</TT>
would <em>not</em> end up pointing to a proper copy of the string,
and they were surprised when it did,
or seemed to.
They specifically wanted to know whether
(a) a later <TT>free()</TT> of <TT>p</TT> would fail,
(b) the <TT>strcpy()</TT> call would fail,
(c) an attempt to print the string <TT>p</TT> would succeed, or
(d) there would be an error.
This is a revised version of my reply.]
<p>
Asking exactly what will happen here is a tough question.
Logically, the question is roughly equivalent to:
<blockquote>
<p>
You come to an intersection of two busy streets.
The light is red, and the sign says ``Don't Walk''.
You cross the street.  What happens?
<p>
(a) a policeman gives you a ticket
<br>
(b) a car hits you and you wind up in the hospital
<br>
(c) a car slams on its brakes and narrowly avoids hitting
you, and its driver makes various rude remarks concerning
your intelligence and your ancestry
<br>
(d) you reach the other side safely
</blockquote>
<p>
You are correct in observing that the code fails to allocate
enough room for the '\0'.
The reason it seemed to work when you tried it is that
sometimes,
answer (d) in my crossing-the-busy-street-against-the-light
analogy applies.
<p>
C is a relatively low-level language.  It is designed to work
efficiently with individual bytes and words in memory; it only
<em>seems</em> to give you access to higher-level concepts like strings.
<p>
The code fragment you presented above asks <TT>malloc</TT> for <i>n</i> bytes
of memory.
<TT>malloc</TT> returns a pointer to some memory, which
the code proceeds to copy <i>n</i>+1 bytes of data to.  Obviously this
is wrong -- well, it's obvious to you and me, but it is <em>not</em>
obvious to <TT>malloc</TT> or <TT>strcpy</TT>.  <TT>strcpy</TT> has no way of knowing how
many bytes' worth of memory it's allowed to copy to; all it
receives is a pointer to the source string and a pointer to
the destination.  In general, pointers are implemented as
straightforward memory addresses; they don't carry around
any extra information concerning the size of the memory regions
they point to.  In general, it's up to <em>you</em>, the programmer,
to ensure that pointers point to enough memory to support the
operations you perform on them.  If the programmer fails, bad
things will probably happen, but we usually can't predict
precisely what the bad things are, or precisely when they'll
happen.  All we can do is try to avoid writing incorrect code
in the first place, and to remember that when we have a program
that's behaving strangely, or seeming to overwrite memory it
shouldn't, or crashing with ``Segmentation Violation'' or ``Bus
Error'' or ``General Protection Fault'', one of the things to go
back and double-check during debugging is whether our pointer
usage is correct.
<p>
When you copy more data to a <TT>malloc</TT>'ed block of data than you
asked for, several things can happen, depending on how far past
the end of the block you accidentally write, and how <TT>malloc</TT> is
implemented, and what your program tries to do next.  Often, if
you write only a little bit too much (e.g. by forgetting to
allocate space for the terminating <TT>'\0'</TT> of a string, which is of
course a rather common mistake), what you overwrite is some of
<TT>malloc</TT>'s internal bookkeeping information.  Often, if this
happens, the <TT>malloc</TT> code won't notice until the <em>next</em> call to
<TT>malloc</TT> or <TT>free</TT> (which might be some distance from the actual
bug, which is one of the things that makes these bugs stubborn
and hard to track down).  And sometimes, <TT>malloc</TT> allocates a bit
more space than you asked for (for its own reasons, e.g. to make
the blocks of allocated memory line up better), meaning you can
(seem to) get away with overflowing the block with no penalty
at all.
<p>
But I hasten to add that everything in the previous paragraph is
``maybe''.  You're not, of course, supposed to copy more data to a
<TT>malloc</TT>'ed block than the block was <TT>malloc</TT>'ed to hold, and if you
do, all bets are off.  The program can do just about anything,
including crash in various ways, or deliver obviously bogus
results, or deliver subtly wrong results that you might not even
notice.  But -- and this is actually rather unfortunate -- the
``just about anything'' that the incorrect program might do also
includes ``doing just what you expected'' (that is, not seeming to
behave incorrectly at all), thus lulling you into a false sense
of security that the code is ``correct'' -- because it ``works'' --
even though it is not correct, works today only by accident, and
might very well stop working tomorrow.

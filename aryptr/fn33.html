Any time you're allocating space for a pointer <TT>p</TT> to point to,
it can be a good idea to use the idiom
<pre>
	p = malloc(n * sizeof(*p));
</pre>
rather than the more obvious
<pre>
	p = malloc(n * sizeof(int));
</pre>
(where of course the type we need the size of isn't necessarily <TT>int</TT>,
but rather whatever type it is that <TT>p</TT> points to<a href="fn34.html" rel=subdocument>[footnote]</a>
).
The reason is that the code is more self-contained,
more self-documenting,
and more robust:
a reader looking at
<pre>
	p = malloc(n * sizeof(*p));
</pre>
can see immediately that the correct amount of space is being allocated,
without looking back at <TT>p</TT>'s declaration to see what type it is.
If <TT>p</TT>'s type ever changes,
the <TT>malloc</TT> call may not have to change.
<br>
<br>
The <TT>sizeof(p)</TT> form can also be seen
in the <TT>array4</TT> and <TT>array5</TT> examples.

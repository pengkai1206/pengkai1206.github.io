As a general rule, you have to be careful when inspecting
compiler-supplied header files, for example the ones in
/usr/include.  Often these make use of ``magic'' features which are
not standard and sometimes not even intended for users to use.
This question, however, has a reasonably straightforward answer,
and it's not tied to any particular compiler.
<p>
&gt; In this file, there is a prototype definition
<br>
&gt;        <TT>extern int isalpha __((int))</TT>.
<br>
&gt; I can not understand &lt;space&gt;<TT>__((int))</TT>. What is meaning of that?
<br>
&gt; My guess is that it is an argument to the function isalpha but
<br>
&gt; how come there is a space in between.
<p>
This is actually a trick.
<p>
As you may know, there are two kinds of external function
prototype declaration in C.  The old-fashioned kind looked like
<p>
<pre>
	extern int isalpha();
</pre>
and says that <TT>isalpha</TT> is a function returning <TT>int</TT>.  The newer,
prototype form (which may be the only kind you're used to) looks
like
<p>
<pre>
	extern int isalpha(int);
</pre>
and supplies the additional information that the <TT>isalpha</TT> function
accepts one argument, of type <TT>int</TT>.
<p>
Sometimes it's useful if a piece of code (in this case, a header
file) can be compiled both by ANSI-compatible and pre-ANSI
compilers.  Function prototypes, however, were introduced along
with the ANSI Standard.  Pre-ANSI compilers didn't understand
function prototypes, and in fact a pre-ANSI compiler will
generally report a ``syntax error'' when it sees a function
prototype.
<p>
The first half of the trick, therefore, is to make the presence
of the function prototype conditional.  Suppose we had the macro
<p>
<pre>
	#define PROTOTYPE(args) args
</pre>
This is a fairly useless-looking macro; all it does is accept one
macro argument and spit it back out.  But suppose we were to
write the prototype for isalpha as
<p>
<pre>
	extern int isalpha PROTOTYPE((int));
</pre>
After the preprocessor expanded the macro, we'd end up with
<p>
<pre>
	extern int isalpha (int);
</pre>
which is just like our original prototype (except for the
insertion of an extra space, which doesn't matter).
<p>
(One additional question here is why we have to invoke the
macro as <TT>PROTOTYPE((int))</TT>, with an extra set of parentheses.
The reason is so that the preprocessor won't complain when we
use the <TT>PROTOTYPE</TT> macro to help us declare a function that takes
multiple arguments.  If we invoked <TT>PROTOTYPE(int, double)</TT>, the
preprocessor would complain that we'd invoked the <TT>PROTOTYPE</TT> macro
with two macro arguments, while it expected only one.  But when
we invoke it as <TT>PROTOTYPE((int, double))</TT>, as far as the
preprocessor is concerned we're invoking it with one argument,
which is ``<TT>(int, double)</TT>'', including one pair of parentheses.)
<p>
Now, however, we have a way to ``turn off'' the prototype.  If we
redefine the <TT>PROTOTYPE</TT> macro as
<pre>
	#define PROTOTYPE(args) ()
</pre>
the macro-ized declaration for isalpha would turn into
<pre>
	extern int isalpha ();
</pre>
and this would be acceptable to a pre-ANSI compiler.  So, putting
this all together, we might say
<p>
<pre>
	#ifdef __STDC__
	#define PROTOTYPE(args) args
	#else
	#define PROTOTYPE(args) ()
	#endif

	extern int isalpha PROTOTYPE((int));
</pre>
<p>
Now we have one scrap of code that's ``backwards compatible''
to a pre-ANSI compiler.  (Obviously we only have to do the
<TT>#ifdef</TT>/<TT>#define</TT>/<TT>#else</TT> thing once, then we can use the <TT>PROTOTYPE</TT>
macro in lots of external function prototype declarations.)
<p>
The only problem with this is that
<pre>
	extern int isalpha PROTOTYPE((int));
</pre>
looks pretty ugly, due to that macro name <TT>PROTOTYPE</TT> sitting in
there.  Someone decided that it was worth trying to fix this.
<p>
The rule for identifiers in C is that they may consist of
letters, digits, and underscore characters, and that the first
character must not be a digit.  This means that the first
character <em>can</em> be an underscore.  But it also means that
identifiers consisting of <em>only</em> underscores are legal!  Using a
single or a double underscore as an identifier is a pretty sneaky
trick, and we obviously can't use it too often, but if we've
decided that writing backwards-compatible function declarations
without that ugly <TT>PROTOTYPE</TT> name is so important that we're
willing to devote this sneaky trick to the task, we can replace
the macro name ``<TT>PROTOTYPE''</TT> with the macro name ``<TT>__</TT>'', leading to:
<p>
<pre>
	#ifdef __STDC__
	#define __(args) args
	#else
	#define __(args) ()
	#endif

	extern int isalpha __((int));
</pre>
<p>
So that explains what you saw.  (Personally, I don't think this
is all worth it, and I don't use this trick, myself, but I've
seen it in plenty of code written by others.)

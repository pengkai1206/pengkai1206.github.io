&gt; Is it also ok to declare the compare function with the correct types for
<br>
&gt; what is being compared and then do a typecast to a defined type like
<br>
&gt; '<TT>typedef int (*fptr)(const void *, const void *);</TT>' inside of the <TT>qsort</TT> call?
<br>
&gt; Please no flames!
<p>
Well, at least a rebuke is certainly called for, because this exact question
is answered in the FAQ list.  NO YOU CAN'T do that.  Or more precisely, most
C implementations will get away with it, but it isn't a portable construct;
code that uses it is not ``strictly conforming'' to the C standard.
<p>
&gt; I got this directly out of the help pages for the
<br>
&gt; Borland C++ 3.1 compiler.
<p>
Presumably those help pages are concerned only with what works on the machines
where the compiler is used, or else their author simply got it wrong.
<p>
&gt; It seems to work and don't see why it wouldn't
<br>
&gt; be portable, but that's why I figured I'd ask anyway ;-).
<p>
Now this question, ``Why can't I?'', is one that's not in the FAQ list.
<p>
First consider this code, which I hope most people will agree is
obviously wrong.
<p>
<pre>
	void fun1(i)
	int i;
	{
		...
	}

	main()
	{
		...
		fun1 (3.14);
		...
	}
</pre>
<p>
Why is it wrong (other than ``because the standard says so'')?  Clearly, it's
because the implementation will put a 3.14 in the place where it passes
doubles, and then in the called function, try to pull an int from the
place where it passes ints.  Now these may or may not be the same place, or
the same size, but even if they are the same place and the same size, the
value received in i will obviously not be 3.14.  Nor will it be <TT>(int)3.14</TT>,
i.e. 3, because nothing in the code calls for a conversion.
<p>
If you declare the function with a prototype, the rules change:
<p>
<pre>
	void fun2 (int i)
	{
		...
	}

	main()
	{
		...
		fun2 (3.14);
		...
	}
</pre>
<p>
This is okay because the 3.14 is converted to int before being passed.
The initial value of <TT>i</TT> will be 3.
<p>
Now consider
<p>
<pre>
	void fun3 (int i)
	{
		...
	}

	main()
	{
		void (*funp)(double);
		...
		funp = (void (*)(double)) fun3;
		funp (3.14);
		...
	}
</pre>
<p>
At the point where the call is made, the implementation is seeing a pointer
to a function whose argument is double, and therefore it will cheerfully
put the 3.14 in the place where it passes doubles, without converting it.
It DOESN'T KNOW at that point that that pointer-to-function was actually
DERIVED FROM a function expecting a different type of argument.  And so,
this code will fail in just the same way as the first example.
<p>
And it makes no difference, of course, if the cast and the function call
take place in different functions:
<p>
<pre>
	void fun4 (int i)
	{
		...
	}

	void funq (void (*funp) (double))
	{
		funp (3.14);
	}

	main()
	{
		...
		funq ((void (*)(double)) fun4);
		...
	}
</pre>
<p>
But now we have arrived at a form equivalent to the one that was being
asked about.  <TT>funq()</TT> corresponds to <TT>qsort()</TT>, in that it expects an argument
which is a pointer to a function with a particular argument type.  And here
it is being given a pointer derived from a function taking a different
argument type.  Again, the code fails in the same way as the first example.
<p>
There is one difference between the above examples and the situation asked
about.  In the examples, the types are <TT>int</TT> and <TT>double</TT>; in the <TT>qsort()</TT> case,
they are two different pointer types.
<p>
Now it happens that on the most commonly used C implementations today,
all pointer types have the same representation and are passed to functions
in the same way.  This fact masks the bug: if the caller places a pointer
of type <TT>struct&nbsp;gnu&nbsp;*</TT> into the place where pointers of that type are placed,
and the called function looks at the place where pointers of type
<TT>const&nbsp;void&nbsp;*</TT> are placed, and it's the same place and the two pointer types have
the same representation, then the code will work.  On machines that don't
work that way, it won't work.
<p>
It's easy to write the code the right way in the first place -- see the
FAQ list for examples.  So do it right.  Please.  And maybe pass this
article on to the next person you see doing it wrong.

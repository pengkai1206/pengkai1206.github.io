</h1>
<p>
<font face=Helvetica size=8 color=blue><b>Q:</b></font>
How do I
construct
declarations of complicated types such as
``array of N pointers to functions returning
pointers to functions returning pointers
to <TT>char</TT>'',
or figure out what similarly complicated declarations mean?
</p><p><hr>
<p>
<font face=Helvetica size=8 color=blue><b>A:</b></font>
The first part of
this
question can be answered in
at least three ways:
<OL><li><TT>char *(*(*a[N])())();
</TT><li>Build the declaration up
incrementally,
using
typedefs:
<pre>
	typedef char *pc;	/* pointer to char */
	typedef pc fpc();	/* function returning pointer to char */
	typedef fpc *pfpc;	/* pointer to above */
	typedef pfpc fpfpc();	/* function returning... */
	typedef fpfpc *pfpfpc;	/* pointer to... */
	pfpfpc a[N];		/* array of... */
</pre>
<li>Use the
<TT>cdecl</TT> program,
which turns English into C and vice versa.
You
provide
a longhand description of the type you want,
and <TT>cdecl</TT> responds with the equivalent C declaration:
<pre>
	cdecl&gt; declare a as array of pointer to function returning
		pointer to function returning pointer to char

	char *(*(*a[])())()
</pre>
<TT>cdecl</TT> can also explain complicated declarations
(you
give it
a complicated declaration
and it responds with an English description),
help with casts,
and indicate which set of parentheses the parameters go in
(for complicated function definitions, like the
one
above).
See question <a href="../resources/tools.html">18.1</a>.
</OL></p><p>C's declarations
can be confusing
because
they come in two parts:
a base type,
and a <a href="../sx1/index.html#declarator"><dfn>declarator</dfn></a>

which contains the identifier or name being declared,
perhaps along with <TT>*</TT>'s and <TT>[]</TT>'s and <TT>()</TT>'s
saying whether the name is
a pointer to, array of, or function returning
the base type,
or some combination.<a href="modifs.html" rel=subdocument>[footnote]</a>
For example, in
<pre>
	char *pc;
</pre>
the base type is <TT>char</TT>,
the identifier is <TT>pc</TT>,
and the declarator is <TT>*pc</TT>;
this tells us
that <TT>*pc</TT> is a <TT>char</TT>
(this

is what
``declaration mimics use''

means).
</p><p>One way to
make sense
of complicated C declarations
is
by reading them ``inside out,''
remembering that <TT>[]</TT> and <TT>()</TT>
bind more tightly than <TT>*</TT>.
For example, given
<pre>
	char *(*pfpc)();
</pre>
we can see that <TT>pfpc</TT> is a pointer
(the inner <TT>*</TT>)
to a function
(the <TT>()</TT>)
to a pointer
(the outer <TT>*</TT>)
to <TT>char</TT>.
When we later use <TT>pfpc</TT>,
the expression
<TT>*(*pfpc)()</TT>
(the value pointed to by the return value
of a function pointed to by <TT>pfpc</TT>)
will be
a
<TT>char</TT>.
</p><p>Another way of analyzing these declarations is to decompose the 
declarator while composing the description, maintaining the 
``declaration mimics use'' relationship:
<br>
<br>
<pre>
	<TT>*(*pfpc)()</TT>	is a	<TT>char</TT>
	<TT>(*pfpc)()</TT>	is a	pointer to <TT>char</TT>
	<TT>(*pfpc)</TT>	is a	function returning pointer to <TT>char</TT>
	<TT>pfpc</TT>	is a	pointer to function returning pointer to <TT>char</TT>
</pre>
</p><p>If you'd like to make things clearer
when declaring
complicated
types like these,
you can make the analysis explicit
by using
a chain of typedefs
as in option
2 above.
</p><p>The pointer-to-function declarations in
the examples above
have not
included
parameter type information.
When the parameters have complicated types,
declarations can <em>really</em> get
messy.
(Modern versions of <TT>cdecl</TT> can help here, too.)

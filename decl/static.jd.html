&gt;|&gt; Looking at Steele's book, it seems to say that the word <TT>static</TT> must
<br>
&gt;|&gt; be present in both places, but it is not clear on this. [...]

&gt; No, if the first declaration declares the object to be a static object
<br>
&gt; (no external linkage), following declarations (and the definition) can
<br>
&gt; omit the `static' keyword. The other way around would result in a
<br>
&gt; compiler warning though ...

Jos Horsmeier has started talking about objects now where Larry Jones
and David Alan Boles were discussing functions.  Unfortunately, function
and object linkages are treated differently.
<p>
The rules that Larry thought apply to functions apply to objects,
while the rules that Jos states for objects apply to functions.
<p>
Example:
<p>
<pre>
/* object */	  /* function */

int o1;		  int f1();		/* external linkage */
static int o2;	  static int f2();	/* internal linkage */
static int o3;	  static int f3();	/* internal linkage */

static int o1;	  static int f1();	/* ERROR, both have external linkage */
int o2;					/* ERROR, o2 has internal linkage */
		  int f2();		/* OK, picks up internal linkage */
extern int o3;	  extern int f3();	/* OK, both pick up internal linkage */
</pre>
<p>
The difference is case (2); where functions do pick up a previous
linkage even without "extern", objects don't.

<br>
&gt;Why would you possibly want to discard the user's input, and
<br>
&gt;how in the world would you know what part to discard?
<p>
The short answers are: &ldquo;You don't, and you don't.&rdquo;
<p>
What is going on here is a kludge piled on top of an already &ldquo;bad&rdquo;
(in some sense) program.  Instead of fixing the actual <em>problem</em>,
certain books that purport to teach C suggest fixing the <em>symptoms</em>.
<p>
This is a bit like going in to the doctor with incipient pneumonia
and being given a cough suppressant.
<p>
The root of the problem is the use of <TT>scanf()</TT>.  The <TT>scanf()</TT> function
is a large and complex beast that often does something almost but
not quite entirely unlike what you desired.
<p>
The entire <TT>scanf()</TT> family works by interpreting &ldquo;directives&rdquo;.  These
directives are not well suited to interactive (&ldquo;talking to a human&rdquo;)
input.  In particular, a directive like &ldquo;&nbsp;&rdquo; or &ldquo;<TT>\n</TT>&rdquo; means: &ldquo;skip as
much input white space as you can find, INCLUDING NEWLINES.&rdquo;  Most
conversion directives (including <TT>%d</TT> and <TT>%f</TT>) have an implicit skip as
well.  This means that if you print a prompt:
<p>
<pre>
	printf("please enter a number: ");
	fflush(stdout);
</pre>
<p>
and then ask for input using `<TT>scanf("%d",&nbsp;&amp;var)</TT>', and the human enters
a blank line, the computer simply sits there, rather than re-prompting.
<p>
The next problem is that the <TT>scanf()</TT> family tend to leave unconsumed
input.  Anything that does not &ldquo;meet the requirements&rdquo; is left in
place.  If the user, who is supposed to enter a number, enters
&ldquo;three&rdquo; instead of &ldquo;3&rdquo;, the &ldquo;t&rdquo; does not meet the requirements for
&ldquo;<TT>%d</TT>&rdquo;.  The entire line (&ldquo;three\n&rdquo;) is left in the input stream.
If the user <em>does</em> enter a number, such as &ldquo;3&rdquo;, only the newline
is left in the stream.  If the user enters a number followed by a
blank (or tab or other whitespace), the blank and newline are both
left in the stream.
<p>
This characteristic (of leaving &ldquo;extra&rdquo; input behind as a trap to
the unwary) leads people to write the &ldquo;discard user's input&rdquo; code.
Unfortunately, they often use implementation-specific constructs like
<TT>fflush(stdin)</TT>, or broken ones like an unadorned <TT>getchar()</TT> or a
<TT>scanf</TT> format like &ldquo;<TT>%*[^\n]%*c</TT>&rdquo;.  To see why this last format is broken,
read the next paragraphs.
<p>
Another substantial problem with the <TT>scanf()</TT> functions is that they
interpret directives sequentially, and stop as soon as they get a
&ldquo;matching failure&rdquo;.  This seems often to surprise people.  In
particular, consider the format directive &ldquo;<TT>%*[^\n]</TT>&rdquo;.  This consists
of several parts.  The &ldquo;<TT>%</TT>&rdquo; introduces the conversion.  The asterisk
&ldquo;<TT>*</TT>&rdquo; suppresses assignment of the result of the conversion, so that
no additional buffer is required.  The &ldquo;<TT>[</TT>&rdquo; specifies that the
conversion is to do a character-class match, the initial &ldquo;<TT>^</TT>&rdquo; inverts
the class, and the class itself consists only of a single character,
&ldquo;<TT>\n</TT>&rdquo;.  The &ldquo;<TT>]</TT>&rdquo; terminates the class and is the end of that directive.
This directive thus means &ldquo;match things that are not newlines&rdquo;.
<p>
The tricky bit here is that any <TT>%[</TT> directive MUST MATCH AT LEAST
ONE CHARACTER.  If it fails to match at least one character, the
scan terminates.  The call returns without looking at any further
directives.  Thus, if the next input character is a newline, this
&ldquo;<TT>%*[</TT>&rdquo; directive fails, and the &ldquo;<TT>%*c</TT>&rdquo; NEVER OCCURS.  The format
sequence &ldquo;<TT>%*[^\n]%*c</TT>&rdquo; only clears out the rest of a line if there
is at least one character before the newline.
<p>
This problem can be fixed (as others noted) by using two separate
calls.  An initial <TT>scanf()</TT> with &ldquo;<TT>%*[^\n]</TT>&rdquo; will either eat everything
up to but not including a newline, or fail.  A subsequent &ldquo;<TT>%*c</TT>&rdquo;
(or plain old <TT>getchar()</TT>) will consume the newline, if there was one.
<p>
That last &ldquo;if&rdquo; matters too: perhaps the user signalled EOF.  In this
case, the <TT>getchar()</TT> or <TT>scanf("%*c")</TT> might -- this decision is left
to the people who write your compiler -- either immediately return
EOF, or go back to the user for more input.  If the implementors
choose the latter, the user might have to click on &ldquo;end this thing&rdquo;
(<TT>^D</TT>, <TT>^Z</TT>, mouse button, front panel switch, or whatever) one extra
time.  This is annoying, if nothing else.
<p>
(Incidentally, offhand, I think <TT>%[</TT> and <TT>%c</TT> are the only two directives
that do not immediately skip whitespace, including newlines.)
<p>
So what <em>is</em> the &ldquo;right&rdquo; answer?  There are various ways to do
this.  You can write horrendously complicated code using <TT>getchar</TT>,
<TT>ungetc</TT>, and <TT>scanf</TT>, carefully checking all the return values.  You
can call <TT>fgets()</TT> to read a complete line, then -- having &ldquo;sandboxed&rdquo;
it, as it were, use <TT>sscanf()</TT> and not worry too much about bad input.
You can call <TT>fgets()</TT> and use <TT>strtol()</TT> and other string-parsing
functions.  The simpler approaches all share one common characteristic,
though:  they first read a complete line (including the terminating
newline), and only then try to pick it apart.  That gives users
time to mull over their answer, type something in, erase it, type
something else, erase that, think a bit more, and then give Regis
Philbin their &ldquo;final answers&rdquo; by pressing ENTER or RETURN. :-) You
then get the whole thing at once, and can dissect it as needed.

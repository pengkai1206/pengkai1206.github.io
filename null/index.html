<H1>5. Null Pointers</H1>

<p><a href="null1.html" rel=subdocument>5.1</a>

What is this infamous null pointer, anyway?
</p><p><a href="null2.html" rel=subdocument>5.2</a>

How do I get a null pointer in my programs?
</p><p><a href="ptrtest.html" rel=subdocument>5.3</a>
Is the abbreviated pointer comparison ``<TT>if(p)</TT>'' to test for
non-null pointers valid?
What if the internal representation for null pointers is nonzero?
</p><p><a href="macro.html" rel=subdocument>5.4</a>
What is <TT>NULL</TT> and how is it
defined?
</p><p><a href="machnon0.html" rel=subdocument>5.5</a>
How should <TT>NULL</TT> be defined on a machine which uses a nonzero bit
pattern as the internal representation of a null pointer?
</p><p><a href="safermacs.html" rel=subdocument>5.6</a>
If <TT>NULL</TT> were defined as
follows:
<pre>
	#define NULL ((char *)0)
</pre>
wouldn't that make function calls which pass an uncast <TT>NULL</TT> work?
</p><p><a href="long0.html" rel=subdocument>5.7</a>
My vendor provides header files that <TT>#define</TT> <TT>NULL</TT> as <TT>0L</TT>.
Why?
</p><p><a href="fcnptr.html" rel=subdocument>5.8</a>
Is <TT>NULL</TT> valid for pointers to functions?
</p><p><a href="nullor0.html" rel=subdocument>5.9</a>
If <TT>NULL</TT> and <TT>0</TT> are equivalent
as null pointer constants,
which should I use?
</p><p><a href="macsochange.html" rel=subdocument>5.10</a>
But wouldn't it be better to use <TT>NULL</TT>
(rather than

<TT>0</TT>),
in case the value of <TT>NULL</TT> changes,
perhaps on a machine with nonzero internal null pointers?
</p><p><a href="nullreq.html" rel=subdocument>5.11</a>
I once used a compiler that wouldn't work unless <TT>NULL</TT> was
used.
</p><p><a href="nullptrmacro.html" rel=subdocument>5.12</a>

I use the preprocessor macro
<pre>
#define Nullptr(type) (type *)0</pre>

to help me build null pointers of the correct type.
</p><p><a href="varieties.html" rel=subdocument>5.13</a>
This is strange.
<TT>NULL</TT> is guaranteed to be <TT>0</TT>, but the null pointer is not?
</p><p><a href="confusion.html" rel=subdocument>5.14</a>
Why is there so much confusion surrounding null pointers?
Why do these questions come up so often?
</p><p><a href="confused2.html" rel=subdocument>5.15</a>
I'm confused.
I just can't understand all this null pointer stuff.
</p><p><a href="confusion4.html" rel=subdocument>5.16</a>

Given all the confusion surrounding null pointers,
wouldn't it be easier simply

to require them to be represented
internally by zeroes?

</p><p><a href="machexamp.html" rel=subdocument>5.17</a>
Seriously, have any actual machines really used nonzero null
pointers,
or different representations for pointers to different types?
</p><p><a href="runtime0.html" rel=subdocument>5.18</a>
Is a run-time integral value of 0,
cast to a pointer,
guaranteed to be a null pointer?
</p><p><a href="accessloc0.html" rel=subdocument>5.19</a>
How can I access
an interrupt vector
located at
the machine's location 0?
If I set a pointer to <TT>0</TT>,
the compiler might translate it to some nonzero internal null
pointer value.
</p><p><a href="nullpassign.html" rel=subdocument>5.20</a>
What does a run-time ``null pointer assignment'' error mean?
How can I track it down?

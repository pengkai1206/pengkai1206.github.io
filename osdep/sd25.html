The functions <TT>usleep</TT> and <TT>nanosleep</TT> do not work for small intervals,
since the kernel [can] change to another task...
<br>
<br>
The solution comes out from I/O instructions.
Writing to I/O ports in ISA addresses will cause the system to wait for 1 microsecond
since
the ISA bus access time is 1 microsecond.
One I/O port that is never used
by the hardware in i386 machines is port 0x80.
<br>
<br>
So, writing one byte to I/O port 0x80 will result in a ``one
microsecond delay''.
This is not so accurate, but at least it will vary
less than 2% (my tests) from a Pentium 100 and a Athlon 850.
<br>
<br>
Some GNU/Linux low-level drivers also use this ``feature'' of writting
to port 0x80.
<br>
<br>
Attached is
<a href="microdelay.c">the program</a>
[and <a href="microdelay.h">the header file</a>]
that I used to do this (you can adapt it to
MS-DOS, I think the functions are <TT>inportb</TT> and <TT>outportb</TT>, but not sure).
<br>
<br>
In GNU/Linux you will need root permissions to write to I/O ports.

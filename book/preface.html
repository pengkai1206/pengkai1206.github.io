[This is the Preface from the book-length version of the C FAQ list:
<I>C Programming FAQs: Frequently Asked Questions</I>,
Addison-Wesley, 1995, ISBN 0-201-84519-9.]

<H1>Preface</H1>

<p>At some point in 1979,
I heard
a lot of

people talking about this relatively new language,
C,
and the book which had just come out about it.
I bought a copy of K&amp;R,
otherwise known as <I>The C Programming Language</I>,
by Brian Kernighan and Dennis Ritchie,
but it sat on my shelf for a while because I didn't have an 
immediate need for it
(besides which I was busy being a college freshman at the time).
It proved in the end to be an auspicious purchase,
though,
because when I finally did take it up,
I never put it down:
I've been programming in C ever since.
</p><p>In 1983,
I came across
the Usenet newsgroup net.lang.c,
which was
(and its successor <a href="news:comp.lang.c">comp.lang.c</a> still is)
an excellent
place to learn
a lot more about C,
and

to find out
what questions everyone else is having about C,
and
to discover
that you may not know all there is to know about C after all.
It seems that C,
despite its apparent simplicity,
has a number of decidedly non-obvious aspects,
and certain questions come up over and over again.
This book is a collection of
some of
those questions,
with answers,
based on the Frequently-Asked Questions
(``FAQ'') list
which I began posting to comp.lang.c in May, 1990.
</p><p>
I hasten to add,
however,
that this book is not
intended as
a critique or ``hatchet job'' on the C language.
It is
all too
easy to blame a language
(or any tool)
for the difficulties its users encounter with it,
or to claim that a properly-designed tool
``ought'' to prevent its users from misusing it.
It would therefore be easy to
regard
a book like this,
with its long lists of misuses,
as a litany of woes
attempting to show that the language is hopelessly deficient.

Nothing could be farther from the case.
</p><p>I would never have learned enough about C

to be able to write this book,
and I would not
be attempting
to make C more pleasant for others to use
by writing this book
now,
if I did not
think that C was a great language
or
if I did not enjoy programming in it.
I <em>do</em> like C,
and one of the reasons that I teach classes in it
and
spend time participating in discussion about it on the Internet
is that I would like to
discover
which aspects of C
(or of programming in general)
are difficult to learn
or keep people from being able to program efficiently and effectively.
This book represents some of what I've learned:
these
questions are certainly some of the ones
people have the most trouble with,
and the answers have been refined over a several-year period
in an attempt to ensure
that people don't have too much trouble with <em>them</em>.

</p><p>A reader will certainly have trouble if there are any errors in these answers,
and although the reviewers
and I have worked hard to eliminate them,
it can be as hard to eradicate the last error from a large 
manuscript as it is to stamp out the last bug in a program.
I will appreciate any corrections or suggestions sent to me
in care of the publisher
or at 
the e-mail address below,
and I would like to offer the customary $1.00 reward
to the first finder of any error.
If you have access to the Internet,
you can check for an errata list
(and a scorecard of the finders)
at the ftp and http addresses
mentioned in <a href="../misc/faqavail.html">question 20.40</a>.
</p><p>
As I hope I've made clear,
this book is not a critique of the C Programming language,
nor is it
a critique of the book from which I 
first learned C,
nor of
that book's authors.
I didn't just learn C from K&amp;R;
I also learned a lot about programming.
As I contemplate my own contribution to the C programming
literature,

my only regret is that
the present book
does not live up to
a nice observation
made
in
the second edition of K&amp;R,
namely that
``C is not a big language,
and it is not well served by a big book.''
I hope that those who most deeply appreciate C's
brevity and precision
(and that of K&amp;R)
will not be too offended
by the fact that this book says some things over and over and over,
or in three slightly different ways.

</p><p>Though my name is on the cover,
there are a lot of people behind this book,
and it's hard to know where to start handing out acknowledgments.
In a sense,
every one of comp.lang.c's readers
(today estimated at




320,000)
is
a contributor:
the FAQ list behind this book was written for comp.lang.c first,
and this book retains
the flavor of a good comp.lang.c discussion.
</p><p>This book also retains,
I hope,
the philosophy of correct C programming
which I began learning
when I started reading net.lang.c.
Therefore,
I
shall
first acknowledge the
posters
who stand out in my mind as
having most clearly and consistently
articulated
that philosophy:
Doug Gwyn,
Guy Harris,
Karl Heuer,
Henry Spencer,
and
Chris Torek.
These gentlemen have displayed
remarkable
patience over the years,
answering
endless questions
with generosity and wisdom.
I was

the one who stuck his neck out and started writing the 
Frequent questions down,
but
I would hate to give the impression that the answers are somehow mine.
I was once the student
(I believe it was
Guy who
answered my post
asking essentially

the present volume's
<a href="../null/macsochange.html">question 5.10</a>),
and I
owe a real debt
to the masters who went before me.
This book is theirs as much as mine,
though I retain title to any inadequacies or mistakes
I've made in the presentation.
</p><p>The former on-line FAQ list
grew by a factor of
three

in the process of becoming this book,
and its growth was a bit
rapid and awkward at times.

Mark Brader,
Vinit Carpenter,
Stephen Clamage,
Jutta Degener,
Doug Gwyn,
Karl Heuer,
Joseph Kent,
and
George Leach
read
proposals or
complete drafts and helped to
exert some control
over the process;
I thank them for their
many careful suggestions and corrections.
Their efforts grew
out of a shared wish to improve the overall understanding

of C in the programming community.
I appreciate their dedication.
</p><p>Three of those reviewers have also been
long-time contributors to the on-line FAQ list.
I thank Jutta Degener
and Karl Heuer for their help over the years,
and I especially thank Mark Brader,
who
has been my most persistent critic ever since I first began 
posting the comp.lang.c FAQ list
five years ago.
I don't know how he has
had

the stamina to
make as many suggestions and corrections as he has,
and to overcome my
continuing stubborn refusal
to agree with some of them,
even though
(as I eventually understood)
they
really <em>were</em> improvements.
You can thank Mark
for
the form of
many of this book's explanations,
and blame me for mangling any of them.
</p><p>Additional
assorted
thanks:
to Susan Cyr for the cover art;
to
Bob Dinse and Eskimo North
for providing the network access 
which is particularly vital to a project like this;
to Bob Holland for providing the computer on which I've done most 
of the writing;
to Pete Keleher for the Alpha text editor;
to the University of Washington
Mathematics Research and Engineering libraries
for access to their collections;
and
to the University of Washington Oceanography department
for letting me borrow their tape drives
to access my dusty old archives of Usenet postings.
</p><p>Thanks
to Tanmoy Bhattacharya
for the example in <a href="../ansi/constmismatch.html">question 11.10</a>,
to Arjan Kenter
for the code in <a href="../lib/regex.html">question 13.7</a>,
to Tomohiko Sakamoto
for the code in <a href="../misc/zeller.html">question 20.31</a>,
and to Roger Miller
for the line in <a href="../ansi/experiment.html">question 11.35</a>.
</p><p>Finally,
I'd like to
thank my editor at Addison-Wesley,
Debbie Lafferty,
for tapping me on the electronic shoulder one day
and asking if I might be interested in writing this book.
I was,
and you now hold it,
and I hope
that it
may
help to make C programming as
pleasant
for you as it is for me.

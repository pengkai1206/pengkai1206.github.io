Subject: Re: C FAQ error?
<p>
The water is surprisingly deep here.  I was initially rather
alarmed by your note, because after rummaging around for some of
my old random number testbeds and dusting them off, I found that
the expression
<pre>
	rand() / (RAND_MAX/N + 1)
</pre>
from the FAQ list doesn't behave as well as I expected it to.
When I then attempted to rederive the appropriate expression,
my first attempt led to
<pre>
	rand() / ((RAND_MAX + 1) / N)
</pre>
which is exactly what you suggested.  But it turns out that the
latter expression doesn't work in the general case.  Suppose
that <TT>RAND_MAX</TT> is 21 and <TT>N</TT> is 10.  (As it happens, this was the
first example I tried.)  So <TT>((RAND_MAX&nbsp;+&nbsp;1)&nbsp;/&nbsp;N)</TT> is then 2, and
when <TT>rand()</TT> returns 20 or 21, the value of the expression is 10,
which is not in [0,&nbsp;<TT>N</TT>).
<p>
I want to study your... derivation some more,
because I think it's basically sound, for the ``|<TT>RAND_MAX</TT>+1| is a
precise multiple of |<TT>N</TT>|'' case.  I suspect that the flaw, however,
is in your assumption that if <TT>RAND_MAX</TT>+1 is not a multiple of <TT>N</TT>,
the same logic applies.  You have to make sure that the result
falls the right way when the intermediate quotient discards a
nonzero remainder, and for this expression, it doesn't.
<p>
Unfortunately, I don't immediately remember how I originally
derived the expression
<pre>
	rand() / (RAND_MAX/N + 1)
</pre>
I share your unease about its dissimilarity to the (much cleaner)
floating-point version
<pre>
	rand() / (RAND_MAX + 1.0) * N
</pre>
I do remember testing the expressions in the FAQ list quite
thoroughly, and I've found <a href="rand.931117.html">an article</a> I posted long ago which
discusses them in some detail, and which suggests that I put
quite a bit of time into that initial derivation.  (It also
suggests that I wasn't perfectly happy with the expression then,
either.)  That article, as I read it now, is nowhere as clear
as I'd like, and I was about to be at a loss to explain how
<pre>
	rand() / (RAND_MAX/N + 1)
</pre>
works at all, until I discovered that the expression is
essentially the same one I explain in the answer to exercise 8
at <a href="http://www.eskimo.com/~scs/cclass/asgn.beg/PS3a.html">http://www.eskimo.com/~scs/cclass/asgn.beg/PS3a.html</a>, which
is worth reading.  (I must confess, though, that I can't imagine
what I was thinking when I started throwing that much detail
around in the third week of an allegedly beginning programming
class.)  But going back to the <TT>RAND_MAX</TT>=21, <TT>N</TT>=10 case, it turns
out that dividing <TT>rand()</TT> by 3, such that we never emit 8 or 9 at
all, is about the best we can do; what we're seeing is one of the
ways that any of these expressions begins to fail when <TT>RAND_MAX</TT>+1
is neither a multiple of nor much greater than <TT>N</TT>.
<p>
For my own reference, here's another way of deriving the
expression <TT>rand()&nbsp;/&nbsp;((RAND_MAX&nbsp;+&nbsp;1)&nbsp;/&nbsp;N)</TT>, even though that
expression doesn't work.  We want to divide <TT>rand</TT>'s output by
some integer y such that the answer is always in the range
0 &lt;= <TT>rand()</TT>/y &lt; <TT>N</TT>.  Now when rand returns <TT>RAND_MAX</TT>, the result
<TT>RAND_MAX</TT>/y should be just barely less than <TT>N</TT>; one way of
achieving this would be if it were the case that (<TT>RAND_MAX</TT>+1)/y
did equal <TT>N</TT>.  So if we set (<TT>RAND_MAX</TT>+1)/y = <TT>N</TT>, we can easily
solve for y = (<TT>RAND_MAX</TT>+1)/<TT>N</TT>.
<p>
But wait!  If we want <TT>RAND_MAX</TT>/y to be just barely less than <TT>N</TT>,
the other way to achieve it is to subtract 1 in the denominator.
So if <TT>RAND_MAX</TT>/(y-1) = <TT>N</TT>, we have y = <TT>RAND_MAX</TT>/<TT>N</TT> + 1, and this
must be where the expression in the FAQ list comes from, after
all.

<H1>1. Declarations and Initializations</H1>

<p><a href="inttypes.html" rel=subdocument>1.1</a>

How should I decide which integer type to use?
</p><p><a href="exactsizes.html" rel=subdocument>1.2</a>
Why aren't the sizes of the standard types precisely defined?
</p><p><a href="int16.html" rel=subdocument>1.3</a>
Since C doesn't define sizes exactly,
I've been using
typedefs
like <TT>int16</TT> and
<TT>int32</TT>.
I can then define these typedefs
to be <TT>int</TT>, <TT>short</TT>, <TT>long</TT>,
etc. depending on what machine I'm using.

That should solve everything, right?
</p><p><a href="octabyte.html" rel=subdocument>1.4</a>
What should the 64-bit type be
on a
machine that can support it?
</p><p><a href="charstarws.html" rel=subdocument>1.5</a>
What's wrong with
this
declaration?
<pre>
char* p1, p2;</pre>




I get errors when I try to
use
<TT>p2</TT>.
</p><p><a href="mimic.html" rel=subdocument>1.6</a>
I'm trying to declare a pointer and allocate some space for it,
but it's
not working.
What's wrong with
this code?
<pre>
char *p;
*p = malloc(10);</pre>


</p><p><a href="decldef.html" rel=subdocument>1.7</a>
What's the best way to declare and define
global variables
and functions?
</p><p><a href="opaque.html" rel=subdocument>1.8</a>
How can I implement
opaque (abstract) data types in C?

</p><p><a href="semiglobal.html" rel=subdocument>1.9</a>
How can I make a sort of ``semi-global'' variable,
that is,
one that's
private to a few functions spread across a few source files?
</p><p><a href="static.html" rel=subdocument>1.10</a>
Do
all
declarations for
the same
<TT>static</TT> function
or variable
have to include the storage class <TT>static</TT>?
</p><p><a href="extern.html" rel=subdocument>1.11</a>
What does <TT>extern</TT> mean in a function declaration?
</p><p><a href="auto.html" rel=subdocument>1.12</a>
What's the <TT>auto</TT> keyword good for?
</p><p><a href="typedefvsdefine.html" rel=subdocument>1.13</a>
What's the difference between using a <TT>typedef</TT>
or

a <TT>#define</TT>
for a user-defined type?
</p><p><a href="selfrefstruct.html" rel=subdocument>1.14</a>

I can't seem to define a linked list
successfully.
I tried
<pre>
	typedef struct {
		char *item;
		NODEPTR next;
	} *NODEPTR;
</pre>
but the compiler gave me error messages.
Can't a structure in C contain a pointer to itself?

</p><p><a href="mutrefstructs.html" rel=subdocument>1.15</a>
How can I define a pair of mutually referential structures?
I tried
<pre>
	typedef struct {
		int afield;
		BPTR bpointer;
	} *APTR;

	typedef struct {
		int bfield;
		APTR apointer;
	} *BPTR;
</pre>
but the compiler doesn't know about
<TT>BPTR</TT>
when it is used in
the first structure declaration.
</p><p><a href="structtypdf.html" rel=subdocument>1.16</a>
What's the difference between
these two declarations?
<pre>
	struct x1 { ... };
	typedef struct { ... } x2;
</pre>

</p><p><a href="pfitypedef.html" rel=subdocument>1.17</a>
What does
<pre>
typedef int (*funcptr)();</pre>

mean?
</p><p><a href="typdfcnst.html" rel=subdocument>1.18</a>
I've got
the declarations
<pre>
	typedef char *charp;
	const charp p;
</pre>
Why is <TT>p</TT> turning out <TT>const</TT>,
instead of the characters pointed to?

</p><p><a href="constasconst.html" rel=subdocument>1.19</a>
I don't understand why I can't
use <TT>const</TT> values in initializers and array
dimensions,
as in
<pre>
	const int n = 5;
	int a[n];
</pre>

</p><p><a href="constptrconst.html" rel=subdocument>1.20</a>
What's the difference between
<TT>const&nbsp;char&nbsp;*p</TT>,
<TT>char&nbsp;const&nbsp;*p</TT>,
and <TT>char&nbsp;*&nbsp;const&nbsp;p</TT>?

</p><p><a href="constparm.html" rel=subdocument>1.20b</a>





</p><p>What does it mean for a function parameter to be <TT>const</TT>?
What do the two <TT>const</TT>'s in
<pre>
	int f(const * const p)
</pre>
mean?
</p><p><a href="cdecl1.html" rel=subdocument>1.21</a>
How do I
construct
declarations of complicated types such as
``array of N pointers to functions returning
pointers to functions returning pointers
to <TT>char</TT>'',
or figure out what similarly complicated declarations mean?
</p><p><a href="recurfuncp.html" rel=subdocument>1.22</a>



How can I declare a function

that can return
a pointer to a function
of the same type?
I'm building a state machine with one function
for each state, each of which returns a pointer to the function for
the next state.
But I can't find a way to declare the
functions--I seem
to need a function
returning a pointer to a function
returning a pointer to a function
returning a pointer to a function...,
ad infinitum.
</p><p><a href="dynarray.html" rel=subdocument>1.23</a>
Can I declare a local array
(or parameter array)
of a size matching a passed-in array,
or set by another parameter?
</p><p><a href="extarraysize.html" rel=subdocument>1.24</a>
I have an <TT>extern</TT> array
which is defined
in
one file,
and used in another:
<pre>
<I>file1.c:</I>			<I>file2.c:</I>

int array[] = {1, 2, 3};	extern int array[];
</pre>
Why doesn't <TT>sizeof</TT> work on
<TT>array</TT> in <TT>file2.c</TT>?
</p><p><a href="implfdecl.html" rel=subdocument>1.25</a>
My compiler is complaining
about an invalid redeclaration of a function,
but I only define it once
and call it once.

</p><p><a href="main.html" rel=subdocument>1.25b</a>
What's the right declaration for <TT>main</TT>?
<br>Is <TT>void&nbsp;main()</TT> correct?
</p><p><a href="argpromo.html" rel=subdocument>1.26</a>
My compiler is complaining about mismatched function prototypes
which look fine to me.
</p><p><a href="headerglom.html" rel=subdocument>1.27</a>
I'm getting strange
syntax errors
on the very first
declaration in
a file,
but it looks fine.


</p><p><a href="bigdatastr.html" rel=subdocument>1.28</a>
My compiler isn't letting me declare a big array

like
<pre>
double array[256][256];</pre>

</p><p><a href="namespace.html" rel=subdocument>1.29</a>
How can I determine
which identifiers are safe for me to use
and which are reserved?
</p><p><a href="initval.html" rel=subdocument>1.30</a>
What
am I allowed to
assume about the initial values of variables
and arrays
which are not explicitly initialized?
<br>If global variables start out as ``zero'',
is that good enough
for null pointers and floating-point zeroes?
</p><p><a href="autoaggrinit.html" rel=subdocument>1.31</a>
This code, straight out of a book, isn't compiling:
<pre>
int f()
{
	char a[] = "Hello, world!";
}
</pre>
</p><p><a href="fcninit.html" rel=subdocument>1.31b</a>
What's wrong with
this initialization?
<pre>
char *p = malloc(10);</pre>

My compiler is complaining about
an ``invalid initializer'',
or something.
</p><p><a href="strlitinit.html" rel=subdocument>1.32</a>
What is the difference between
these initializations?
<pre>
char a[] = "string literal";
char *p  = "string literal";
</pre>
My program
crashes if
I try to
assign a new value to <TT>p[i]</TT>.
</p><p><a href="nonstring.html" rel=subdocument>1.33</a>
Is <TT>char&nbsp;a[3]&nbsp;=&nbsp;"abc";</TT> legal?
</p><p><a href="ptrfuncinit.html" rel=subdocument>1.34</a>
I finally figured out the syntax for declaring pointers to
functions, but now how do I initialize one?
</p><p><a href="initunion.html" rel=subdocument>1.35</a>
Can I initialize unions?

<p>
<font face=Helvetica size=8 color=blue><b>Q:</b></font>
How can I read data from
data files with particular formats?
<br>How can I read ten floats without having to use a jawbreaker 
<TT>scanf</TT> format
<br>like
<TT>"%f&nbsp;%f&nbsp;%f&nbsp;%f&nbsp;%f&nbsp;%f&nbsp;%f&nbsp;%f&nbsp;%f&nbsp;%f"</TT>?
<br>How can I read an arbitrary number of fields from a line into an array?
</p><p><hr>

In general, there are three

main ways
of parsing data lines:
</p><OL><li>Use
<TT>fscanf</TT> or <TT>sscanf</TT>,
with
an appropriate format string.
Despite the limitations
mentioned in this section
(see question <a href="scanfprobs.html">12.20</a>),
the <TT>scanf</TT> family is quite powerful.
Though whitespace-separated fields are always the easiest to 
deal with,
<TT>scanf</TT> format strings can also be used
with more 
compact,
column oriented, FORTRAN-style data.
For instance, the line
<pre>
	1234ABC5.678
</pre>
could be
read
with <TT>"%d%3s%f"</TT>.
(See also the last example in question <a href="scanfjam.html">12.19</a>.)
<li>Break the line into
fields separated by
whitespace
(or some other delimiter),
using <TT>strtok</TT> or the equivalent
(see question <a href="../lib/strtok.html">13.6</a>),
then deal with each field individually,
perhaps with functions like <TT>atoi</TT>
and <TT>atof</TT>.
(Once the line is broken up,
the code for handling the fields
is much like the traditional code in <TT>main()</TT>
for handling the <TT>argv</TT> array;
see question <a href="../misc/argv.html">20.3</a>.)
This method is particularly useful
for reading an arbitrary
(i.e. not known in advance)
number
of fields from a line into an array.
<p>Here is a simple example
which copies a line of
up to 10
floating-point numbers



(separated by whitespace)
into an array:
<pre>
#define MAXARGS 10

char line[] = "1 2.3 4.5e6 789e10";
char *av[MAXARGS];
int ac, i;
double array[MAXARGS];

ac = makeargv(line, av, MAXARGS);
for(i = 0; i &lt; ac; i++)
	array[i] = atof(av[i]);
</pre>

(See question <a href="../lib/strtok.html">13.6</a>
for the definition of <TT>makeargv</TT>.)
</p><li>Use whatever pointer manipulations
and library routines
are handy
to parse the line in an
ad-hoc way.
(The ANSI <TT>strtol</TT> and <TT>strtod</TT> functions
are particularly useful for this style of parsing,
because they can return a pointer
indicating where they stopped reading.)
This

is obviously the most general way,
but it's also the most difficult and error-prone:
the
thorniest
parts
of
many
C programs
are
those which use lots of
tricky
little pointers to pick apart strings.
</OL><p>When
possible, design data files and input formats
so that they don't require arcane manipulations,
but
can
instead
be parsed with easier techniques
such as 1 and 2:
dealing with the files will
then

be
much more pleasant
all around.

<p><a href="multretval.html" rel=subdocument>20.1</a>
How can I return
multiple
values from a function?
</p><p><a href="ragged.html" rel=subdocument>20.2</a>
What's a good data structure to use
for storing lines of text?
I started to use
fixed-size
arrays of arrays of <TT>char</TT>,
but they're just too restrictive.
</p><p><a href="argv.html" rel=subdocument>20.3</a>
How can I open files mentioned on the command line,
and parse option flags?
</p><p><a href="errno.html" rel=subdocument>20.4</a>
What's the right way
to use <TT>errno</TT>?
</p><p><a href="binaryfiles.html" rel=subdocument>20.5</a>
How can I write data files which can be read on other machines
with different
word size,
byte order,
or floating point
formats?
</p><p><a href="symtab.html" rel=subdocument>20.6</a>
If I have a <TT>char&nbsp;*</TT> variable
pointing to
the name of a function,
how can I call that function?
Code like
<pre>
	extern int func(int, int);
	char *funcname = "func";
	int r = (*funcname)(1, 2);
</pre>
or
<pre>
	r = (*(int (*)(int, int))funcname)(1, 2);
</pre>
doesn't seem to work.
</p><p><a href="intovf.html" rel=subdocument>20.6b</a>

How do I swap bytes?
</p><p><a href="hexio.html" rel=subdocument>20.10</a>
How can I convert integers to
binary or
hexadecimal?

</p><p><a href="base2.html" rel=subdocument>20.11</a>
Can I use base-2 constants
(something like <TT>0b101010</TT>)?
<br>Is there a
<TT>printf</TT> format for binary?
</p><p><a href="bitcount.html" rel=subdocument>20.12</a>
What is the most efficient way to count the number of bits
which are set in
an integer?

What's the best way of making my program efficient?
</p><p><a href="eff2.html" rel=subdocument>20.14</a>
Are pointers really faster than arrays?
How much do function calls slow things down?
Is <TT>++i</TT> faster than <TT>i&nbsp;=&nbsp;i&nbsp;+&nbsp;1</TT>?
</p><p><a href="shifts.html" rel=subdocument>20.15</a>
I've been replacing multiplications and divisions
with shift operators,
because shifting is more efficient.
</p><p><a href="unsshift.html" rel=subdocument>20.15b</a>
People claim that optimizing compilers are good
and that we no longer have to write things in assembler for speed,
but
my compiler
can't even
replace <TT>i/=2</TT> with a shift.
</p><p><a href="swapnotemp.html" rel=subdocument>20.15c</a>
How can I swap two values without using a temporary?
</p><p><a href="switchimpl.html" rel=subdocument>20.16</a>
Which is more efficient,
a <TT>switch</TT> statement or an <TT>if</TT>/<TT>else</TT> chain?
</p><p><a href="strswitch.html" rel=subdocument>20.17</a>
Is there a way to <TT>switch</TT> on strings?
</p><p><a href="nonconstcase.html" rel=subdocument>20.18</a>
Is there a way to have non-constant <TT>case</TT> labels
(i.e. ranges or arbitrary expressions)?
</p><p><a href="returnparens.html" rel=subdocument>20.19</a>
Are the outer parentheses
in <TT>return</TT> statements
really optional?

Why don't C comments nest?
How am I supposed to comment out code containing comments?
Are
comments
legal inside quoted strings?
</p><p><a href="multibreak.html" rel=subdocument>20.20b</a>
Why isn't there a numbered, multi-level <TT>break</TT> statement
to break out of several loops at once?
What am I supposed to use instead, a <TT>goto</TT>?
</p><p><a href="funkyasgnop.html" rel=subdocument>20.21</a>
There seem to be a few missing operators, like <TT>^^</TT>, 
<TT>&amp;&amp;=</TT>, and <TT>-&gt;=</TT>.
</p><p><a href="circshift.html" rel=subdocument>20.21a</a>
Does C have circular shift operators?
</p><p><a href="quintplus.html" rel=subdocument>20.21b</a>
Is C a great language, or what?
Where else could you write something like
<TT>a+++++b</TT>
?
</p><p><a href="colonequal.html" rel=subdocument>20.22</a>
If the assignment operator were <TT>:=</TT>,
wouldn't it then be harder to accidentally write things like
<TT>if(a&nbsp;=&nbsp;b)</TT> ?

Does C have an equivalent to Pascal's
<TT>with</TT> statement?
</p><p><a href="nestfcns.html" rel=subdocument>20.24</a>

Ada, LISP) functions from C?
(And vice versa?)
</p><p><a href="langtran.html" rel=subdocument>20.26</a>
Does anyone know of a program
for converting
Pascal or FORTRAN
(or
LISP,
Ada,
awk,
``Old'' C,
...)
to C?
</p><p><a href="cplusplus.html" rel=subdocument>20.27</a>

(Was 2000 a leap year?)
</p><p><a href="leapsec.html" rel=subdocument>20.33</a>
Why can <TT>tm_sec</TT>
in the <TT>tm</TT> structure
range from 0 to 61,
suggesting that there can be 62 seconds in a minute?
</p><p><a href="quine.html" rel=subdocument>20.34</a>
Here's a good puzzle:
how
do you write a program which produces its own source code as
output?

<p>
Sort of; in fact depending on how you think about the question,
there are several functions.  But those functions don't work
quite like you think they do, because you're thinking about the
question in a different way, one which it turns out doesn't make
as much sense.
<p>
<TT>&gt;</TT> The sort of function I'm thinking of is:
<br>
<TT>&gt;</TT>
<pre>
&gt;	#include &lt;math.h&gt;
&gt;
&gt;	int binary_to_decimal(int number)
&gt;	{
&gt;		int decimal = 0;
&gt;		int i, digit;
&gt;
&gt;		for(i = 0; i &lt; length(number); i++)
&gt;		{
&gt;			digit = substring(number, i);
&gt;			/* where, say, substring(11011, 2) returns 0 */
&gt;			/* but I'm not sure about this part */
&gt;
&gt;			if(digit == 1)
&gt;				decimal += pow(2,i);
&gt;		}
&gt;
&gt;		return decimal;
&gt;	}
</pre>
<p>
You've got the right basic algorithm there, and if your ``number''
variable (that is, the input of your function) was a <em>string</em>,
you'd have a perfectly useful function.  Notice, too, that if you
changed the lines
<p>
<pre>
	if(digit == 1)
		decimal += pow(2,i);
</pre>
to
<pre>
	decimal += digit * pow(2, i);
</pre>
you could make the program work for any base, just by changing
the value 2 to something else.
<p>
<TT>&gt;</TT> but I don't know how to get <TT>substring(number, i)</TT> to work.
<p>
That's because you're thinking of a ``number'' as a string of
digits.  But integers are <em>not</em> represented internally as strings
of digits.
<p>
Now, <em>if</em> your function did accept a string of digits (that is,
if its input argument were of type string, not int), it would be
easy enough to get your hands on each digit, because of course
it's always easy to get your hand on the individual characters
that make up a string.
<p>
(There is no standard ``substring'' function in C, although it's
easy enough to write one, although as its name implies, it's
almost invariably designed to solve the general problem of
extracting substrings from a string, not necessarily single
digits.  And, once again, what it would be extracting from is
a string variable, not an integer variable.)
<p>
How were you planning on passing a ``binary'' number to your
function?  Were you thinking of calling something like this?
<p>
<pre>
	binary_to_decimal(11011);
</pre>
In that call, you haven't passed the binary number
one-one-oh-one-one; you've passed the <em>decimal</em> number eleven
thousand and eleven.  I suppose you could write some code that
accepted decimal numbers with the digits all 0 or 1, and
pretended it was a binary number, and ``converted'' it to decimal,
but this would be a confusing and not very useful function.
(To get at the digits, you'd end up dividing by 10, which would
be a strange thing to do to extract bits which you were thinking
of as being in base two.)
<p>
You were trying to write a function that accepted an int, and
that returned an int.  Presumably you were intending one of those
ints to be in ``base 2'' and one of them to be in ``base 10''.  But
it really doesn't make sense to talk about what ``base'' an integer
is in; an integer is just a <em>number</em>.  The ``base'' only matters
when we write numerals out on paper.
<p>
Here is an example.  How many x's are there on this line?
<pre>
	xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
</pre>
Is your answer in base two or base ten?  The question doesn't
make much sense.  If you said ``seventeen'', your answer is not in
base two or base ten; your answer is in English.  Seventeen is
the <em>number</em> of x's on the line.
<p>
We can represent numbers in different bases.  If we represent
the number seventeen in base ten, we get the numeral 17.  If we
represent it in base two, we get the numeral 10001.  But the
number of x's on the line didn't change when we switched from
17 base ten to 10001 base two.
<p>
I believe that the right way to think of the numbers stored in
int variables as just that: numbers.  It doesn't really matter,
or make sense to ask, what base they're in.  (In truth, on a
modern computer, integers are virtually always stored in binary,
but most of the time, that fact really doesn't concern us.)
<p>
Here's one way to convince yourself that ints in C are just
numbers.  Suppose you have an int variable
<pre>
	int i;
</pre>
and you print it out using <TT>printf</TT>:
<p>
<pre>
	printf("%d\n", i);
</pre>
<p>
Now, as you probably know, <TT>printf</TT> can also print things out in
base 8 and base 16.  So we could also write
<p>
<pre>
	printf("%o\n", i);
</pre>
or
<pre>
	printf("%x\n", i);
</pre>
<p>
Do we have to match the <TT>printf</TT> format we use (<TT>%d</TT>, <TT>%o</TT>, or <TT>%x</TT>) to
the base of the number we're printing?  No, because as I was
saying, the int variable <TT>i</TT> is just a number; it doesn't have any
inherent base.  (Or, if it does have an inherent base, it's base
two, meaning that all three <TT>printf</TT> conversions involve a conversion
from base 2 to some other base.)
<p>
In fact, one answer to the question ``how do I convert a binary
number to decimal?'' in C is, ``print it out using <TT>printf %d</TT>''.
The answer only works if you think of ints as being base two
internally, and it probably isn't the answer you expected if you
were trying to convert binary to decimal explicitly, but it is a
very real answer.  (If the binary number you had was a string of
0's and 1's, then what you really wanted to do was just to
convert that string to an int, perhaps so that you could print
it back out using %d.)
<p>
If we believe (as I do) that int variables are ``just numbers'',
then the only times it makes sense to talk about what base
they're in are when we print them out for people in the real
world to look at on paper or on the screen, or when we read them
in from people in the real world who are poking at keyboards
containing keys with the digits 0 through 9 on them.  In those
cases, just about all of the conversions are taken care for us
automatically, without our hardly being aware of it:
<p>
<OL>
<li>
When we write a C program containing a line like
<pre>
	int i = 1234;
</pre>
the C compiler automatically converts those decimal
digits <TT>1&nbsp;2&nbsp;3&nbsp;4</TT> to an integer.  If we want to, we can
enter integer constants in base 8 or base 16:
<pre>
	int j = 0123;
	int k = 0x123;
</pre>
and the compiler does octal or hexadecimal conversion,
as appropriate.
<p>
<li>
When we print an integer, using <TT>printf</TT> or the like, it's
printed in base 10 if we use <TT>%d</TT>, or in base 8 or 16 if
we use <TT>%o</TT> or <TT>%x</TT>.
<p>
<li>
When we request numeric input from the user, and we
choose to use <TT>scanf</TT> or the like, we again select the base
using the format character, <TT>%d</TT>, <TT>%o</TT>, or <TT>%x</TT>.
<p>
<li>
When we have a string that we want to convert to an
integer, we can call the <TT>atoi</TT> function:
<pre>
	char *str = "123";
	int i = atoi(str);
</pre>
<TT>atoi</TT> always does decimal conversion.
<p>
<li>
Finally, if we have a string in an arbitrary base, we
can convert it to an integer using the <TT>strtol</TT> function:
<pre>
	char *str2 = "1234";
	i = strtol(str2, NULL, 7);
</pre>
This converts the string <TT>"1234"</TT>, interpreted as a numeral
in base 7, to an integer, and stores it in <TT>i</TT>.  (If we
then printed <TT>i</TT> back out using <TT>%d</TT>, we'd see the decimal
numeral 466, which is 1234 base 7.)
</OL>
<p>
So <TT>strtol</TT> is the other standard C library function that's often
useful in realistic base conversion problems, and it's one of the
only standard C library functions that lets you specify an
arbitrary base.  (You can also specify the base as 0, in which
case <TT>strtol</TT> will use the same rules the C compiler uses, namely
that a leading 0 indicates base 8 and a leading <TT>0x</TT> indicates base
16.  It turns out that <TT>scanf</TT> can do this, too, using the <TT>%i</TT>
format.)
<p>
You'll notice that every standard function (or other language
feature) that seems to have anything to do with base conversion
is either converting from an integer to a string or printed
representation, or is converting from a string or printed
representation to an integer.  You won't find a ``base conversion''
function that ``converts'' from integer to integer, because as I've
explained, that ``conversion'' doesn't make sense.  Integers are
not stored internally as strings of digits.  If, however, you
want to think about the ``base'' of a numeral, that's a concept
which only makes sense (in fact, which is defined) in terms of
strings of digits.
<p>
If you'd like to truly understand base conversion, in the
contexts where it really comes up when writing modern computer
programs, here are a few functions for you to write.
<p>
<OL>
<li>
Write a function which accepts a string of digits and
converts it to an integer, interpreting the string of
digits as a numeral in base 10.  This function will
actually be a lot like the ``conversion'' function you were
trying to write, except that (a) it accepts a string, not
an int; (b) it will be easy to access the digits (that
is, to perform the ``substring'' operation), because a
string in C is just an array of characters, and array
subscripting is easy; and (c) you'll be converting from
base 10, not base 2.  (Also, you can get away without
calling <TT>pow()</TT> at all, if you arrange things right.  If
you convert the digits in left-to-right order, all you
have to do is keep a running sum, and at each digit,
multiply the previous sum by 10 before adding in the new
digit.)
<p>
If you write this function, you'll essentially have
reimplemented the standard library <TT>atoi()</TT> function.
<p>
One other problem you may encounter is dealing with
digits as characters.  Your input is a string like
<TT>"1234"</TT>, so the digits are characters, like <TT>'1'</TT>.
But the value of the character <TT>'1'</TT> in ASCII is <em>not</em> 1.
But it turns out that converting digit characters to
their appropriate digit values is easy: just subtract the
character set value of the character <TT>'0'</TT>, whatever that is.
<TT>'0'&nbsp;-&nbsp;'0'</TT> is obviously 0, no matter what value <TT>'0'</TT> has.
Similarly, <TT>'1'&nbsp;-&nbsp;'0'</TT> is 1.  So if you have a character
variable <TT>c</TT>, containing one of the digit characters <TT>'0'</TT>
through <TT>'9'</TT>, then <TT>c&nbsp;-&nbsp;'0'</TT> is the decimal value of that
digit.
[The point here is that you do <em>not</em> need to know what
the character set value of the character <TT>'0'</TT> is;
all you need to do is subtract the character constant <TT>'0'</TT>.]
<p>
<li>
Write a function which accepts a string of digits and an
integer value <TT>b</TT>, and converts the string to an integer,
interpreting the string of digits as a numeral in base <TT>b</TT>.
Basically, all you'll have to do is take your function
from #1 and change ``10'' to ``<TT>b</TT>''.  When you're done, you'll
have reimplemented part of the standard library <TT>strtol()</TT>
function.
[And you can use it, if you like, to perform ``binary to decimal conversion'',
by calling it with a base of 2.
As we've discussed, this is actually ``binary to number conversion'',
not ``binary to decimal''.]
<p>
<li>
Write a function which accepts an integer and creates a
string of digits forming the base 10 representation of
the integer.  (Your compiler may already have such a
function, perhaps called ``<TT>itoa</TT>'', although it's not a
Standard function.)  As you write this function, you'll
essentially be reimplementing the task which <TT>printf</TT>
performs when it prints something using <TT>%d</TT>.
<p>
It's actually easy enough to compute the digits of a
number's base-10 representation: you can take <TT>i&nbsp;%&nbsp;10</TT> to
pick off the rightmost digit, and then say <TT>i&nbsp;=&nbsp;i&nbsp;/&nbsp;10</TT> to
throw away the rightmost digit (since you already picked
it off), and then say <TT>i&nbsp;%&nbsp;10</TT> again to pick off what had
been the next-to-rightmost digit, etc.
<p>
One tricky part of writing this function is that it gives
you the digits the wrong way around: it picks them off in
right-to-left order, while you probably wanted to print
them out, or store them in string, in left-to-right
order.  There are various ways around this problem.
(Another tricky part is converting digit values to
characters, but here all you have to do is use the
inverse of the trick mentioned under #1 above: if <TT>d</TT>
is a digit value you've computed, then <TT>d&nbsp;+&nbsp;'0'</TT> is the
character value you want.)
<p>
<li>
Write a function which accepts an integer and creates a
string of digits forming the base <TT>b</TT> representation of the
integer, where <TT>b</TT> is another int argument to the function.
(Some compilers come with an <TT>itoa</TT> function which also
accepts a base.)  Basically, all you'll have to do is
take your function from #3 and change ``10'' to ``<TT>b</TT>''.
</ol>
<p>
Finally, if you do write these functions, and get them to work,
take a look: your functions in #1 and #2 convert <em>from</em> base 10
or base <TT>b</TT>, and your functions in #3 and #4 convert <em>to</em> base 10
or base <TT>b</TT>.  But what base do your functions in #1 and #2 convert
<em>to</em>?  What base do your functions in #3 and #4 convert <em>from</em>?
You can't tell; all they really convert to and from is ``ints''.
The base (if it's even meaningful to ask what it is) is implicit;
the details of the internal representation of integers are all
taken care of for you by your C compiler, the machine code it
generates, and by your machine's CPU.  You did a certain amount
of multiplying or dividing by 10 or <TT>b</TT>, but the ``other'' base was
essentially built in to the multiplication and division
operators.  If you had to ``port'' the code you wrote from a
machine that used binary integers internally to a hypothetical
one that used decimal integers internally, you wouldn't have to
change a thing.  All of these facts underlie my claim that it
doesn't make much sense to ask what base these ints are in;
they're just numbers.

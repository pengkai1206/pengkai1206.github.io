However, declaring the typedefs first means that they could
concievably clash with previous declarations of structs a or b,
meaning that
it could conceivably be necessary to precede
the typedef declarations with the lines
<pre>
	struct a;
	struct b;
</pre>
although again, putting those typedefs after the
complete structure definitions would clearly be
preferable in that case.

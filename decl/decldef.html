<font face=Helvetica size=8 color=blue><b>Q:</b></font>
What's the best way to declare and define
global variables
and functions?
</p><p><hr>
<p>
<font face=Helvetica size=8 color=blue><b>A:</b></font>
First, though there can be many
<a href="../sx1/index.html#declarations"><dfn>declarations</dfn></a>
(and in many translation units)
of a single
global
variable
or function,
there must be exactly one
<a href="../sx1/index.html#definition"><dfn>definition</dfn></a>.
<a href="unused.html" rel=subdocument>[footnote]</a>
For global variables,
the
definition is the declaration that actually allocates space,
and provides an initialization value, if any.
For functions,
the definition is
the ``declaration''

that provides the function body.
For example,

these are declarations:
<pre>
	extern int i;

	extern int f();
</pre>
and these are definitions:
<pre>
	int i = 0;

	int f()
	{
		return 1;
	}
</pre>
(Actually, the keyword <TT>extern</TT> is optional in function 
declarations;
see question <a href="extern.html">1.11</a>.)
</p><p>When you need to share variables or functions
across several
source files,
you will of course want to ensure
that all definitions and declarations are consistent.
The best arrangement
is to
place each
definition in some relevant
.c file.
Then,
put
an external declaration in a
header
(``<TT>.h</TT>'')
file,
and <TT>#include</TT> it
wherever the declaration is needed.
The <TT>.c</TT> file containing the definition should also <TT>#include</TT> the
same header file,
so the compiler can check
that the definition matches the declarations.
</p><p>This rule promotes a high degree of portability:

it
is consistent with the requirements of the ANSI C Standard,
and is also consistent with most pre-ANSI compilers and linkers.
(Unix
compilers and linkers typically use a ``common model''
which allows multiple definitions,
as long as at most one is initialized;
this
behavior is mentioned as a ``common extension'' by
the ANSI Standard,
no
<a href="common.html">pun</a>
intended.
A few
very old
systems
might once have required
an explicit initializer to
distinguish a definition from an external declaration.)
</p><p>It is possible to use preprocessor tricks
to arrange that
a line like
<pre>
	DEFINE(int, i);
</pre>
need only be entered once in one header file,

and turned into a definition or a declaration
depending on the setting of some macro,
but it's not clear if
this is
worth the trouble,
especially since it's usually a
better
idea
to keep global variables to a minimum.
</p><p>It's
not just a good idea
to put global declarations in header files:
if you want the compiler
to
be able to
catch inconsistent declarations for you,
you <em>must</em> place them in header files.
In particular,
never place a prototype for an external function
in a .c file--if
the definition of the function ever changes,
it would be too easy to forget to change the prototype,
and an incompatible
prototype is worse than useless.

[Someone found it confusing that
``one should not have to free all memory before exiting'',
but that
it can be considered
``good programming practice to explicitly free memory''.
This was my reply.]

Well, the situation is (unfortunately) fundamentally a bit
complicated.  I'd say you ``shouldn't have to'' free memory,
and plenty of people would agree with me, but there are probably
some who would disagree, and would say that remembering to free
memory is, in fact, the programmer's responsibility.  Most ``real''
operating systems do take seriously their responsibility to
reclaim all resources upon program exit; under these operating
systems, everyone would agree that if a program were to neglect
to free all memory before exiting and for that memory to then
become irretrievably lost would be a serious bug, a bug in the
operating system itself, not a bug in the application program.
<p>
But on the other hand, supposedly there are systems which, for
whatever reason, do not definitively reclaim memory, and under
these systems, a programmer must either explicitly free all
memory or else suffer its loss forever (or until the next
reboot, presumably).
<p>
Finally, quite aside from what the operating system is or isn't
guaranteed to do, there are questions of what a responsible
programmer ought to do.  Under some circumstances, it is a very
good idea to take the trouble to free all (or most) memory.
Under some other circumstances, it is clearly more trouble
than it's worth to free memory -- if a program has lots of
complicated, interconnected, dynamically-allocated memory
structures, and if the program is about to exit, going to great
lengths to free all the memory might add nothing more to the
program beyond a bigger code-space footprint, a slightly longer
running time, and a higher probability of bugs.  (How would
you
like to have a program crash when it was trying to exit, and
to discover that it crashed while trying to free some memory
which the operating system would have reclaimed anyway?)
<p>
&gt; Perhaps, this last paragraph should say more emphatically that in
<br>
&gt; certain situations it is important to explicitly free memory (give
<br>
&gt; example with little code segment ?), but in other situations, it may not
<br>
&gt; be a good idea (give example).

If you're using a deficient operating system which doesn't reclaim
memory at program exit, you must free your memory yourself.
If your program is a long-running server which never exits,
you must free memory as you're finished with it, otherwise all
available memory will eventually ``leak away''.  If you're writing
a program which does one job and exits, but which might be
rewritten later to run for a long time and to perform multiple
repetitions of its task, it might be easier to write the
necessary free-memory-on-task-completion code today, while the
data structures and their memory allocation strategies are all
fresh in your mind.  Finally, if you're using an automated
``leak tracing'' tool, which warns you about any block of memory
which you allocate but neglect to free, and which you're using in
an attempt to track down a memory leak in a portion of your code
which is constantly allocating and freeing memory, you may find
it useful to ``fix'' all of the allocations, that is, to explicitly
free every scrap of memory you ever allocate, even those one-time
allocations which you would have been content to have the
operating system implicitly clean up for you, so that the automatic
tool's extra complaints abut those one-time allocations won't
make it harder to see its complaints about the real leaks which
you do care about tracking down and fixing.
<p>
In a program, on the other hand, which does one task (though
perhaps a long, complicated task) and then exits, which allocates
a lot of dynamic memory in the process of performing that task,
and which needs the majority of the memory for the duration of
the processing of the task, trying to explicitly free it all
would be a waste of time, and in fact it could be advisable
(from the standpoints of programming time, code size, run time,
and reliability) not to make the attempt.

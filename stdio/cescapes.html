[Someone asked me whether it was or wasn't obvious that the way to
print a single <TT>%</TT> sign using <TT>printf</TT> was with the (correct)
<TT>"%%"</TT> or the (incorrect) <TT>"\%"</TT>.
This is part of my reply, edited slightly for this web page.]

If you're used to thinking 
about how a C program really ``works'' -- how the compiler 
generates an executable program, and how functions get called at 
run time -- then it really can be obvious that <TT>\%</TT> can't possibly 
work, and that the solution has to be something like <TT>%%</TT>.
<p>
Suppose that you write this program:
<p>
<pre>
	main()
	{
	char line[80];
	fgets(line, 80, stdin);
	fputs(line, stdout);
	}
</pre>
<p>
Obviously, this program reads one line from standard input and 
prints it right back out again.  Suppose that the line you type 
at it consists of the 8 characters
<p>
<pre>
	abc\ndef
</pre>
<p>
What gets printed?
The answer is,
one line, consisting of the 8 characters
<p>
<pre>
	abc\ndef
</pre>
<p>
You might think that it would instead print the two lines
<p>
<pre>
	abc
	def
</pre>
<p>
(In fact, it occurs to me that ``Why <em>doesn't</em> it print two 
lines?'' is an FAQ which I've never added to the list.)
<br>
[But I was wrong; it's question 8.8.]
<p>
Why <em>doesn't</em> it print two lines?  Why aren't the two characters 
<TT>\n</TT> interpreted as a single newline character, as they are in 
character and string constants in source code?  Because those 
backslash escapes for various special characters are 
interpreted <em>only</em> in character and string constants in source 
code.  Furthermore, they're interpreted by the compiler, at 
compile time, in the process of converting your source code into 
an executable program.  None of the standard I/O functions 
(<TT>fgets</TT>, <TT>fputs</TT>, <TT>printf</TT>, etc.) ever do any interpretation of 
backslashes.  As far as they're concerned, a backslash is just 
another character
being read or written.
By the time these functions are running, any 
backslashes which had been in the source code (that is, in 
character or string constants which had been handed to these 
functions to work on) will already have been processed.
<p>
That is, when 
<TT>fgets()</TT> reads a <TT>\</TT> from the input file, it just places it into 
the array with all of the other characters.  But when you write
<p>
<pre>
	printf("Hello, world!\n");
</pre>
<p>
<TT>printf</TT> receives a string consisting of 14 characters (not 
including the terminating <TT>\0</TT>).  The 14th character in the string 
is a single newline character, however that's represented 
internally.  <TT>printf</TT> does <em>not</em> receive the two characters <TT>\</TT> and <TT>n</TT>,
nor does it have to translate them into a newline character.
The compiler did that already.
<p>
If you understand this, it's pretty obvious that
<p>
<pre>
	printf("\%");
</pre>
<p>
can't work.  What will the compiler translate <TT>\%</TT> into?
As it happens, <TT>\%</TT> isn't a legal special-character sequence, but
by analogy with <TT>\'</TT>, <TT>\"</TT>, and <TT>\\</TT>, it's likely that the compiler 
will convert <TT>\%</TT> into a single <TT>%</TT> character.  (It may also 
generate a warning message about the undefined escape sequence.)
So <TT>printf</TT> will probably receive a string consisting of a single <TT>%</TT>, 
<em>exactly</em> as if you'd simply typed
<p>
<pre>
	printf("%");
</pre>
<p>
Whenever printf sees a <TT>%</TT> character in its format string, it 
<em>always</em> looks at the next character(s) to decide what to print.  
But there is no following character, so <TT>printf</TT> is confused.
<p>
I understand why you expect <TT>\%</TT> to work -- in some contexts,
at least, the <TT>\</TT> ``turns off'' the special interpretation of the 
following character.  (That's what it's doing when you write <TT>'\''</TT>
or <TT>"This string contains a \" and a \\"</TT>.)  So when you want to 
print a single <TT>%</TT>, you want to ``turn off'' <TT>printf</TT>'s special 
interpretation of the <TT>%</TT> character, and the first thing you think 
of is the backslash.  But wait: the backslash turns off special 
interpretation of characters <em>by the compiler</em>, while what you 
want is to turn off special interpretation of a character <em>by
<TT>printf</TT></em>.  The two contexts are completely separate, so the rules 
might be different, and in fact the rules <em>are</em> different.
(The first context is ``string constants being processed by the 
compiler'', and in that context, the rule for turning off special 
interpretation of certain characters is to precede them with a
backslash.  The second context is ``format strings being
interpreted by <TT>printf''</TT>, and in that context, the rule is
that if you want a single <TT>%</TT>, you write <TT>%%</TT>.)

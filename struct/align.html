[Someone asked me why it was that structures need internal paddding.
This was my reply.]

It's for ``alignment''.  Many processors can't access 2- and
4-byte quantities (e.g. ints and long ints) if they're crammed
in every-which-way.
<p>
Suppose you have this structure:
<p>
<pre>
	struct	{
		char a[3];
		short int b;
		long int c;
		char d[3];
		};
</pre>
<p>
Now, you might think that it ought to be possible to pack this
structure into memory like this:
<p>
<pre>
	+-------+-------+-------+-------+
	|           a           |   b   |
	+-------+-------+-------+-------+
	|   b   |           c           |
	+-------+-------+-------+-------+
	|   c   |           d           |
	+-------+-------+-------+-------+
</pre>
<p>
But it's much, much easier on the processor if the compiler
arranges it like this:
<p>
<pre>
	+-------+-------+-------+
	|           a           |
	+-------+-------+-------+
	|       b       |
	+-------+-------+-------+-------+
	|               c               |
	+-------+-------+-------+-------+
	|           d           |
	+-------+-------+-------+
</pre>
<p>
In the ``packed'' version, notice how it's at least a little bit
hard for you and me to see how the b and c fields wrap around?
In a nutshell, it's hard for the processor, too.
Therefore, most compilers will ``pad'' the structure
(as if with extra, invisible fields)
like this:
<p>
<pre>
	+-------+-------+-------+-------+
	|           a           | pad1  |
	+-------+-------+-------+-------+
	|       b       |     pad2      |
	+-------+-------+-------+-------+
	|               c               |
	+-------+-------+-------+-------+
	|           d           | pad3  |
	+-------+-------+-------+-------+
</pre>

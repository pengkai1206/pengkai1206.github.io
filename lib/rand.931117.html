It won't be a ``real'' 0-1 range; it will still be quantized into
150 (i.e. <TT>RAND_MAX</TT>) distinct values, and the nonuniformity will
persist.
<p>
The question of how to produce pseudorandom numbers in a given
range is frequently-asked and not nearly as trivial as it might
at first appear.  One might well wonder why it is not addressed
in the comp.lang.c FAQ list -- the reason is that I have not been
satisfied with my own understanding of the subject.  Having spent
much of today exploring at least one facet of the issue to my
satisfaction, I am ready to say a few words about this latest
incarnation of the ``help with random #s!'' thread, and provide an
inverse outline of the entry which I will soon add to the FAQ
list. (I say ``inverse outline'' because the entry to be added to
the FAQ list will in fact be an outline or summary of this
article, which will be considerably too long for an FAQ list
entry.)
<p>
We will consider several ways of writing the routine
<pre>
	int myrand(unsigned int n)
</pre>
, which is supposed to return well-distributed random integers in
the half-open interval [0,&nbsp;<TT>n</TT>); that is, integers x such that
0 &lt;= x &lt; <TT>n</TT>.  All of our attempts at writing <TT>myrand</TT> will be based
on the underlying, ANSI Standard <TT>rand</TT> routine, which returns
integers in the closed interval [0,&nbsp;<TT>RAND</TT>_MAX].  (It is obviously
trivial to use our extend <TT>myrand</TT> to generate random numbers for
ranges which are not 0-based.)  <TT>RAND_MAX</TT> is #defined in
<TT>&lt;stdlib.h&gt;</TT>; that header should be considered to be #included in
the code fragments below.
<p>
There are a couple of things to worry about when writing <TT>myrand</TT>.
One is that many existing <TT>rand</TT> implementations are deficient; in
particular, they are not very random in the low-order bits.
Another is that unless <TT>n</TT> is much less than <TT>RAND_MAX</TT>, <TT>myrand</TT>'s
output distribution is likely to be lopsided.
<p>
The most obvious way of writing <TT>myrand</TT> is
<p>
<pre>
	myrand1(n)
	unsigned int n;
	{
	return rand() % n;
	}
</pre>
<p>
It is a very great tragedy that this implementation cannot be
generally used, because it otherwise displays a number of
significant virtues, and would otherwise be preferable to the
alternatives which I shall consider, all of which have
deficiencies of their own.
<p>
One of <TT>myrand1</TT>'s virtues is that it is very obvious how it works,
and that it works.  Another is that it does not require knowing
<TT>RAND_MAX</TT>, which is useful when code must be portable to pre-ANSI
systems.  Still another is that its output distribution is
superior (when <TT>n</TT> is not much less than <TT>RAND_MAX</TT>) to another
alternative which I shall consider later on.
<p>
However, the widespread existence of poor <TT>rand</TT> implementations
dooms <TT>myrand1</TT> for general-purpose use.  If the underlying <TT>rand</TT>
implementation is a linear congruential random number generator
with period m, and if <TT>n</TT> in <TT>myrand1</TT> is a divisor of m, then
<TT>myrand1</TT>'s output will repeat with period <TT>n</TT> [Knuth Volume 2
Sec. 3.2.1.1; p. 12 in the second edition].  If m matches the
computer's word size and is a power of 2 (a popular choice), then
sequential calls to <TT>myrand1(2)</TT> will generate output which
alternates 0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 1...
<p>
Our second attempt at implementing <TT>myrand</TT> gets at the higher
order bits of <TT>rand</TT>'s output by using <TT>RAND_MAX</TT> and floating point:
<p>
<pre>
	myrand2(n)
	unsigned int n;
	{
	return (double)rand() / ((double)RAND_MAX + 1) * n;
	}
</pre>
<p>
<TT>myrand2</TT> works well; its only real disadvantage is that it uses
floating point, which can decrease speed and increase executable
size.
<p>
(It is often claimed that an implementation like <TT>myrand2</TT> will
also overcome distribution problems if <TT>n</TT> approaches <TT>RAND_MAX</TT>; but
this belief is quite false, as a moment's thought will
demonstrate.  As long as <TT>rand</TT>'s output domain is quantized and
consists of <TT>RAND_MAX+1</TT> values, no simple mapping, floating or
integral, can avoid maldistribution when <TT>(RAND_MAX+1)&nbsp;%&nbsp;n</TT>&nbsp;!=&nbsp;0.)
<p>
If we can't trust <TT>rand</TT> to be random in the low-order bits, and we
don't want to use floating point, we can use what amounts to a
fixed-point version of <TT>myrand2</TT>:
<p>
<pre>
	myrand3(n)
	unsigned int n;
	{
	return rand() / (RAND_MAX / n + 1);
	}
</pre>
<p>
This is probably the preferable routine for general-purpose use.
Its only drawback is that if <TT>n</TT> is greater than about <TT>RAND_MAX/2</TT>,
it will not only distribute its outputs unevenly, but some values
will not appear at all.  (As <TT>n</TT> approaches <TT>RAND_MAX</TT>, <TT>myrand1</TT> has a
bimodal distribution, but <TT>myrand3</TT> tends to have a trimodal
distribution, with some values at zero.  <TT>myrand2</TT>, on the other
hand, will display the same number of ``heavy'' outputs as myrand1,
but spread out over the range.)  However, as long as <TT>n</TT> is much
less than <TT>RAND_MAX</TT>, as is usually the case, <TT>myrand3</TT> should be
perfectly adequate.
<p>
If you want to avoid the discrepancies that arise when
<TT>(RAND_MAX+1)&nbsp;%&nbsp;n</TT>&nbsp;!=&nbsp;0, you don't have much choice but to call
<TT>rand</TT> multiple times, as in our final attempt:
<p>
<pre>
	#define MAXTIMES 5 
	myrand4(n)
	unsigned int n;
	{
	int d = ((unsigned)RAND_MAX + 1) / n;
	unsigned int m = d * n;
	int i;
	int r;

	for(i = 0; i &lt; MAXTIMES; i++)
		{
		r = rand();
		if((unsigned)r &lt; m)
			return r / d;
		}

	return r / (RAND_MAX / n + 1);
	}
</pre>
<p>
Here, we throw away some of <TT>rand</TT>'s output values, to simulate
another random number generator with a period which is a multiple
of <TT>n</TT>.  The obvious concern is that if we're really unlucky, we
may hit a long run of these discarded values, and waste a lot of
time calling <TT>rand</TT> during one call to <TT>myrand4</TT>.  (In fact, if we
wait long enough, we
might get an arbitrarily long
string of values we need
to discard.)  Therefore, the code above implements a limit; if it
gets too many bad values in a row, it falls back to to <TT>myrand3</TT>'s
algorithm.  (The code displays a classic tradeoff between time
and accuracy: the larger you make <TT>MAXTIMES</TT>, the less will be the
accumulated error, but the longer you might spend on a particular
call.  If <TT>MAXTIMES</TT> is 1, <TT>myrand4</TT> is essentially <TT>myrand3</TT>.)
<p>
Since this is obviously a rather pedagogical article, I can't
resist suggesting a few exercises for the reader.  (I include
these as exercises not only because they are interesting but also
because it's getting late and I don't feel like figuring out and
presenting their answers; therefore, please don't send me e-mail
asking for the answers or inquiring whether your answers are
correct.)
<ol>
<p><li>
Write <TT>myrandmn(int m,&nbsp;int n)</TT>, which returns integers in
the range <TT>m</TT> to <TT>n</TT>.  Use <TT>myrand</TT> to do most of the work.
Should <TT>myrandmn</TT> be defined in terms of a closed or
half-open interval?
<p><li>
Explain the presence of the +1 ``fudge factors'' in
<TT>myrand2</TT>, <TT>myrand3</TT>, and <TT>myrand4</TT>.  Is the expression in
<TT>myrand3</TT> parenthesized correctly?
<p><li>
Why does <TT>myrand</TT> accept an unsigned value?  (This one I do
have an answer for; see below.)
<p><li>
Fix <TT>myrand3</TT> so that in the worst case it has a bimodal
rather than trimodal distribution, yet still uses no
floating point.  Consider using something like Walker's
Algorithm [Knuth Volume 2 Sec. 3.4.1; p. 115 in the
second edition].
<p><li>
Improve <TT>myrand4</TT> so that when it does have to break out of
the loop to avoid too many calls to rand, it at least
spreads the ``leftover'' values around evenly, rather than
always favoring the same values that <TT>myrand3</TT> favors.
Hint: you'll probably need a local static variable.
<p><li>
Investigate the behavior of various <TT>myrand</TT>
implementations, in conjunction with several underlying
<TT>rand</TT> implementations, some with good and some with poor
randomness properties.  Make <TT>RAND_MAX</TT> artificially small,
to explore in detail the behavior as <TT>n</TT> approaches
<TT>RAND_MAX</TT>.  Collect histograms to display the output
distribution.  Verify whether the output repeats with
unacceptably low period.
</ol>
<p>
Finally, a few disclaimers.  As I mentioned, random numbers are
subtle, and not nearly as trivial as they might at first appear.
Knuth devotes some 177 pages to the subject, not all of which I
can claim to understand completely, yet he does not touch on many
of the implementation issues I have raised here.  This article
satisfies one level of my own curiosity about the subject, but is
by no means definitive.  My assessment of the tradeoffs between
the four code fragments I have presented is superficial; there
are a few additional factors I haven't fully explained, and
doubtless more which I'm not fully aware of.  I just wrote
<TT>myrand3</TT> today and don't distinctly remember seeing something like
it before, it may have some lurking deficiency as ultimately
fatal as <TT>myrand1</TT>'s.

<TT>myrand</TT> accepts unsigned values so that it works in
the limiting case, namely <TT>myrand(RAND_MAX+1)</TT>, when
<TT>RAND_MAX&nbsp;==&nbsp;INT_MAX</TT> (as is usually the case).

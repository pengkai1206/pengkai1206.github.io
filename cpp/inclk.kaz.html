Let me draw you a diagram.

<p>
Mnemonic: the <TT>&lt;&gt;</TT> suggests enclosure.
<p>
According to the language standard, a C implementation searches for headers in
two different ``places'' if they are included with <TT>""</TT>. It first looks in one
place, and if it doesn't find the header there, it looks in the other place. 
<p>
Headers that are included with <TT>&lt;&gt;</TT> are only searched for in the second place.
<p>
Imagine that the above diagram is being visited from outside in.
<p>
How this is done in actual implementations is quite commonly like this:
headers included with <TT>""</TT> are first looked for in the same place where their
parent file (the one containing the <TT>#include</TT>) is located. If they are not found
there, certain pre-defined places are searched; usually directories containing
headers that came with the implementation.
<p>
Various compilers have various ways to influence the behavior, which leads some
programmers to structure their projects in various clever ways, such as
separating the include files from the source files.  Sometimes people even
influence the compilers to use <TT>&lt;&gt;</TT> searching for their own 
<p>
The most portable thing to do is to use <TT>""</TT> for including files within your
project, to use <TT>&lt;&gt;</TT> only for implementation supplied files.  Furthermore, at
least for small to moderately sized projects, the easiest thing to do is to
have all of the files collected in one place (i.e directory). This poses the
fewest build management and portability headaches.

<font face=Helvetica size=8 color=blue><b>Q:</b></font>
Why is there so much confusion surrounding null pointers?
Why do these questions come up so often?
</p><p><hr>
<p>
<font face=Helvetica size=8 color=blue><b>A:</b></font>
C programmers traditionally like to know
a lot
(perhaps
more than they
need to)
about the underlying machine implementation.
The fact that null pointers are represented both in source code,


and internally to most machines,

as zero
invites unwarranted assumptions.
The use of a preprocessor macro (<TT>NULL</TT>)
may seem to suggest
that the value could change
some day,
or
on some weird machine.

The construct ``<TT>if(p&nbsp;==&nbsp;0)</TT>''
is easily misread
as calling for conversion of <TT>p</TT> to an integral type,
rather than
<TT>0</TT> to a pointer type,
before the comparison.
Finally, the distinction between the several uses of the term
``null''
(listed
in question <a href="varieties.html">5.13</a>)
is often overlooked.
</p><p>One good way to wade out of the confusion is to imagine that C
used a
keyword (perhaps <TT>nil</TT>,
like Pascal)
as a null pointer constant.
The compiler could either turn <TT>nil</TT> into the
appropriate
type of null pointer
when it could
unambiguously determine
that type
from the source code,

or complain when it could not.
Now in fact,
in C the keyword for a null pointer constant is not
<TT>nil</TT> but <TT>0</TT>,
which works almost as well,
except that an uncast <TT>0</TT> in a non-pointer context
generates an integer zero
instead of an error message,
and if that uncast <TT>0</TT> was supposed to be a null pointer constant,
the
resulting program
may not work.

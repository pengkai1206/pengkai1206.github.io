<H1>16. Strange Problems</H1>


<p><a href="emptyloop.html" rel=subdocument>16.1</a>
Why is this loop always executing once?
<pre>
	for(i = start; i &lt; end; i++);
		{
		printf("%d\n", i);
		}
</pre>
</p><p><a href="unclosed.html" rel=subdocument>16.1b</a>
I'm getting baffling syntax errors which make no sense at all,
and it seems like large chunks of my program aren't being compiled.
</p><p><a href="procedure.html" rel=subdocument>16.1c</a>
Why isn't my procedure call working?
The compiler seems to skip right over it.
</p><p><a href="headerglom.html" rel=subdocument>16.2</a>
I'm getting strange
syntax errors
on the very first
declaration in
a file,
but it looks fine.


</p><p><a href="biglocal.html" rel=subdocument>16.3</a>
This program crashes before it even runs!
(When single-stepping with a debugger, it dies before the first
statement in <TT>main</TT>.)
</p><p><a href="crashatexit.html" rel=subdocument>16.4</a>
I have a program that seems to run correctly,
but
it
crashes as it's exiting,
<em>after</em>
the last statement in <TT>main()</TT>.
What could be causing this?
</p><p><a href="funnybugs.html" rel=subdocument>16.5</a>
This program runs perfectly on
one machine,
but I get weird results on
another.
Stranger still,
adding or
removing a debugging printout
changes the symptoms...
</p><p><a href="strlitnomod.html" rel=subdocument>16.6</a>
Why does
this code:
<pre>
char&nbsp;*p&nbsp;=&nbsp;"hello,&nbsp;world!";
p[0]&nbsp;=&nbsp;'H';</pre>

crash?
</p><p><a href="ptralign.html" rel=subdocument>16.7</a>
</p><p>I've got some code that's trying to unpack external structures, 
but it's crashing
with a message about an ``unaligned access.''
What does this mean?
The code looks like this:
<pre>
struct mystruct {
	char c;
	long int i32;
	int i16;
} s;

char buf[7], *p;
fread(buf, 7, 1, fp);
p = buf;
s.c = *p++;
s.i32 = *(long int *)p;
p += 4;
s.i16 = *(int *)p;
</pre>
</p><p><a href="segv.html" rel=subdocument>16.8</a>
What
do
``Segmentation violation'',
``Bus error'',
and
``General protection fault''
mean?
What's a ``core dump''?

<p>
<font face=Helvetica size=8 color=blue><b>Q:</b></font>
I can't get <TT>strcat</TT> to work.
I tried
<pre>
	char *s1 = "Hello, ";
	char *s2 = "world!";
	char *s3 = strcat(s1, s2);
</pre>
but I got strange results.

As in question <a href="malloc1.html">7.1</a>,
the main problem here
is that space for the concatenated result is
not properly allocated.
C does not provide an automatically-managed string type.

C compilers allocate memory
only for objects explicitly
mentioned in the source code
(in the case of strings,
this

includes character arrays and string literals).
The programmer must
arrange
for sufficient space for
the results of run-time operations such as string concatenation,
typically by declaring arrays, or by calling <TT>malloc</TT>.
</p><p><TT>strcat</TT> performs no allocation;
the second string is appended to the first one,
in place.
The first
(destination)
string must
be writable and
have enough room

for the concatenated result.
Therefore, one fix would be to declare the first string as
an
array:
<pre>
	char s1[20] = "Hello, ";
</pre>
(In production code,
of course,
we wouldn't use magic numbers like ``20'';
we'd use more robust mechanisms
to guarantee sufficient space.)
</p><p>Since <TT>strcat</TT>
returns the value of its first argument
(<TT>s1</TT>, in this case),
the variable <TT>s3</TT>
in

the question above
is
superfluous;
after the call to <TT>strcat</TT>,
<TT>s1</TT> contains the result.
</p><p>The original call to <TT>strcat</TT> in the question
actually has

two problems:
the string literal pointed to by <TT>s1</TT>,
besides not being big enough for any concatenated text,
is not necessarily writable
at all.

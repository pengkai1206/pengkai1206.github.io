[Someone questioned the statement,
``If you really need to declare a pointer to an entire array,
use something like int (*ap)[N];''.
This was my response.]

&gt; i was wondering about something stated in the answer
<br>
&gt; to question 6.13 of the c-faq:
<br>
&gt;
<br>
&gt; ``If you really need to declare a pointer to an entire
<br>
&gt; array, use something like <TT>int (*ap)[N];</TT> where <TT>N</TT> is
<br>
&gt; the size of the array.''
<br>
&gt;
<br>
&gt; doesn't <TT>(int (*ap)[n])</TT> mean ``array of pointers to <TT>int</TT>''?
<br>
<p>
Nope!
<p>
&gt; if not, how why and how would you declare an
<br>
&gt; array of pointers to int, then.
<br>
<p>
That'd be simply
<p>
<pre>
	int *ap[N];
</pre>
The difference is in the parentheses.
In C, there are precedence relationships in declarations, too,
and when the default precedence isn't what you want, you use
explicit parentheses to override it.
<p>
To see very clearly how this works, let's first look at two
examples from the world of expressions, one simple, one a bit
more complicated.
<p>
When you write
<p>
<pre>
	x = 1 + 2 * 3;
</pre>
how is that interpreted?  Multiplication has higher precedence
than addition, so 2 is multiplied by 3 and the result added to 1.
If you wanted 1 to be added to 2 and then multiplied by 3,
you'd use parentheses:
<p>
<pre>
	x = (1 + 2) * 3;
</pre>
When you write
<p>
<pre>
	int a[] = {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10};
	int *ip = &amp;a[5];

	x = *ip++;
</pre>
<p>
how is that interpreted?  Does <TT>*ip++</TT> mean to follow the pointer
(that is, take the pointed-to contents of) <TT>ip</TT> and increment what
it points to, or increment the pointer <TT>ip</TT> and (because this is
the postincrement form) take the contents of what it used to
point to?  Postfix <TT>++</TT> has higher precedence than unary prefix <TT>*</TT>,
so the interpretation is that the pointer is incremented -- <TT>x</TT>
gets set to 5, and <TT>ip</TT> ends up pointing to <TT>a[6]</TT>.  If you wanted
to increment the pointed-to location, you'd again use explicit
parentheses to override the default precedence: saying
<p>
<pre>
	x = (*ip)++;
</pre>
sets <TT>x</TT> to 5, and leaves <TT>ip</TT> pointing at <TT>a[5]</TT>, and increments <TT>a[5]</TT>
to contain 6.
<p>
(This is probably not the best example, because you may have a
hard time seeing that <TT>x</TT> gets set to 5 in both cases, not 6.
Trust me, it does.  Postfix <TT>++</TT> means that the ``old'' value of the
thing being incremented always gets used, whether the thing being
incremented is the pointer <TT>ip</TT> or the pointed-to array element <TT>a[5]</TT>.)
<p>
Finally, let's look at declarations.  If you write
<p>
<pre>
	 int *ap[10];
</pre>
are you declaring an array of pointers, or a pointer to an array?
In declarations, the brackets <TT>[]</TT> which describe arrays have
higher precedence than the <TT>*</TT> which describes pointers.  It looks
like the <TT>*</TT> and the <TT>[]</TT> are both next to the identifier <TT>ap</TT>, but
since <TT>[]</TT> has higher precedence it means that the brackets are
``closer'' -- <TT>ap</TT> is an array first, and what it's an array of is
pointers.  If you really wanted a pointer to an array (though
usually you do not) you once again override the default
precedence using explicit parentheses:
<p>
<pre>
	 int (*pa)[10];
</pre>
says that <TT>pa</TT> is a pointer first, and what it's a pointer to is an
array.
<p>
Fortunately (and this is no accident) pointers to arrays are
much, much rarer than arrays of pointers, so the natural syntax
(without the parentheses) is almost always what you want.
(Outside of examples for the FAQ list, I'm not sure I've used
a pointer to an array in all my years of C programming.)

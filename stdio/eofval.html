<p>
<font face=Helvetica size=8 color=blue><b>Q:</b></font>
I have a simple little program that reads characters until EOF,
but how do I actually <em>enter</em> that ``EOF'' value
from the keyboard?
I see that <TT>EOF</TT> is defined by <TT>&lt;stdio.h&gt;</TT> to be -1;
am I supposed to enter -1?
</p><p><hr>

If you think about it,
what you enter <em>can't</em> be -1,
because ``-1'' is two characters,
and <TT>getchar</TT> is reading one character at a time.
It turns out that the value of EOF as seen within your C program
has essentially nothing to do with the keystroke combination you
might
use to signal end-of-file from the keyboard.
EOF is essentially a signal to your program
that no more characters
will be available
from that input,
for <em>whatever</em> reason
(end of a disk file,
user is done typing,
network stream has closed,
I/O error, etc.).
</p><p>Depending on your operating system,
you indicate end-of-file
from the keyboard
using various keystroke combinations,
usually either control-D or control-Z.
The operating system and stdio library then arrange
that your C program receive the EOF value.
(Note, however, that there are various translations involved along the way.
Under normal circumstances,
you should <em>not</em> explicitly check for
the control-D or control-Z value yourself,
nor will you find that
the <TT>&lt;stdio.h&gt;</TT> macro
<TT>EOF</TT> is defined to be either of these values.)

The point is that character constants are <em>not</em> of type char!
<TT>sizeof(char)</TT> is 1, while <TT>sizeof(int)</TT> is 2 or 4 on most machines.
Now, a constant like <TT>'a'</TT>, even though it looks like a
character, is actually an integer as far as the compiler is
concerned, so <TT>sizeof('a') == sizeof(int)</TT>.

It's only confusing if you assume that character constants are chars.
It makes perfect sense if you know the rule that ``character
constants are of type int'', even if that rule doesn't seem to
make much sense in itself.

[Despite everything that's been written on this topic,
people keep claiming that <TT>void main()</TT> must be okay
because it ``works for them''.
Here is part of a reply I sent to someone who made this claim by mail.]

<!-- &lt;200005310341.UAA25347@mail.eskimo.com&gt; -->
<p>
Declaring <TT>main()</TT> as <TT>void</TT> is kind of like saying ``ain't''.
Everyone will know what you mean, but it's not ``correct English'',
and people who care about correct English will think less of you
for saying it.
<p>
Suffice it to say that, just because <TT>void&nbsp;main()</TT> works for you,
doesn't mean it's right.  If you run a red light in the middle of
the night and no policeman arrests you, does that mean it's okay
to run red lights?  If you have the ball in a basketball game and
you take three steps without dribbling and the ref doesn't
notice, does that mean that traveling is legal in basketball?

<!-- qtag -->Question 12.20
</h1>
<p>
<font face=Helvetica size=8 color=blue><b>Q:</b></font>
Why does everyone say not to use <TT>scanf</TT>?
What should I use instead?
</p><p><hr>
<p>
<font face=Helvetica size=8 color=blue><b>A:</b></font>
<TT>scanf</TT>
has
a number of problems--see questions
<a href="scanfhang.html">12.17</a>,
<a href="scanfinterlace.html">12.18a</a>,
and
<a href="scanfjam.html">12.19</a>.
Also, its <TT>%s</TT>

format has the same problem
that <TT>gets()</TT> has
(see question <a href="getsvsfgets.html">12.23</a>)--it's
hard to guarantee that
the receiving buffer
won't overflow.
<a href="overflow.html" rel=subdocument>[footnote]</a>
</p><p>More generally,
<TT>scanf</TT> is designed for relatively structured,
formatted input
(its name is
in fact
derived from
``scan
formatted'').
If you pay attention,
it will tell you whether it succeeded or failed,
but it can tell you only approximately where it failed,
and not at all how or why.
You have very little opportunity to do any error recovery.
</p><p>Yet interactive user input
is the least structured
input there is.
A well-designed user interface
will allow for the possibility of the user typing just about 
anything--not
just letters or punctuation when digits were expected,
but also more or fewer characters than were expected,
or no characters at all
(i.e. just the RETURN key),
or premature EOF,
or anything.
It's nearly
impossible
to deal gracefully
with all of these potential problems
when using <TT>scanf</TT>;
it's
far
easier
to read entire lines
(with <TT>fgets</TT> or the like),
then interpret them,
either using <TT>sscanf</TT>
or some other techniques.
(Functions like
<TT>strtol</TT>,
<TT>strtok</TT>,
and
<TT>atoi</TT>
are often useful;
see also
questions <a href="datafmts.html">12.16</a> and <a href="../lib/strtok.html">13.6</a>.)
If you do use
any <TT>scanf</TT> variant,
be sure
to check the return value
to make sure that the expected number of items were

found.
Also,
if you use <TT>%s</TT>,
be sure to guard
against buffer overflow.

</p>
<p>Note,
by the way,
that
criticisms of
<TT>scanf</TT>
are not necessarily indictments of
<TT>fscanf</TT>
and <TT>sscanf</TT>.
<TT>scanf</TT> reads from <TT>stdin</TT>,
which is usually an interactive keyboard
and is therefore the least
constrained,
leading to the most problems.

When a data file has a known format,
on the other hand,
it may be appropriate to read it with <TT>fscanf</TT>.
It's perfectly appropriate to parse strings with <TT>sscanf</TT>
(as long as the return value is checked),
because it's so easy to regain control,
restart the scan,
discard the input if it didn't match,
etc.

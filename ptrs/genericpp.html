<font face=Helvetica size=8 color=blue><b>Q:</b></font>
Suppose I want to write a function that takes a generic pointer
as an argument and I want to simulate passing it by reference.
Can I give the formal parameter type <TT>void&nbsp;**</TT>,
and do something like this?
<pre>
	void f(void **);
	double *dp;
	f((void **)&amp;dp);
</pre>
</p><p><hr>

Not portably.
Code like this may work and is sometimes recommended,
but it
relies on
all pointer types having the same internal representation
(which is common, but not universal;
see question <a href="../null/machexamp.html">5.17</a>).
</p><p>There is no generic pointer-to-pointer type in C.
<TT>void&nbsp;*</TT> acts as a generic pointer
only because
conversions
(if necessary)
are applied automatically when other pointer types
are assigned to and from <TT>void&nbsp;*</TT>'s;
these conversions cannot be performed
if an attempt is made
to indirect upon a <TT>void&nbsp;**</TT> value
which points at
a pointer type
other than <TT>void&nbsp;*</TT>.

When you make use of a <TT>void&nbsp;**</TT> pointer value
(for instance, when you use the <TT>*</TT> operator
to access the <TT>void&nbsp;*</TT> value
to which the <TT>void&nbsp;**</TT> points),
the compiler has no way of knowing
whether that <TT>void&nbsp;*</TT> value
was once converted from some other pointer type.
It must assume that it is nothing more than a <TT>void&nbsp;*</TT>;
it cannot perform any implicit conversions.
</p><p>In other words,
any <TT>void&nbsp;**</TT> value you play with
must be the address of an actual <TT>void&nbsp;*</TT> value somewhere;
casts like <TT>(void&nbsp;**)&amp;dp</TT>,
though they may shut the compiler up,
are
nonportable
(and may not even do what you want;
see also question <a href="../lib/qsort2.html">13.9</a>).
If the pointer that the <TT>void&nbsp;**</TT> points to
is not a <TT>void&nbsp;*</TT>,
and if
it
has a different size or representation than a <TT>void&nbsp;*</TT>,
then
the compiler

isn't going to be able to access it correctly.

</p><p>To make the code fragment above work,
you'd have to use an intermediate <TT>void&nbsp;*</TT> variable:
<pre>
	double *dp;
	void *vp = dp;
	f(&amp;vp);
	dp = vp;
</pre>
The assignments to and from <TT>vp</TT>
give the compiler the opportunity to perform any conversions,
if necessary.
</p><p>Again,

the discussion so far assumes that different pointer types
might have different sizes or representations,
which is rare today,
but not unheard of.
To
appreciate the
problem with <TT>void&nbsp;**</TT> more clearly,
compare the situation to an analogous one involving, say,
types <TT>int</TT> and <TT>double</TT>,
which probably have different sizes
and certainly have different representations.
If we have a function
<pre>
	void incme(double *p)
	{
		*p += 1;
	}
</pre>
then we can do something like
<pre>
	int i = 1;
	double d = i;
	incme(&amp;d);
	i = d;
</pre>
and <TT>i</TT> will be incremented by 1.
(This is analogous to the correct <TT>void&nbsp;**</TT> code 
involving the auxiliary <TT>vp</TT>.)
If, on the other hand,
we were to attempt something like
<pre>
	int i = 1;
	incme((double *)&amp;i);	/* WRONG */
</pre>
(this code is analogous to the fragment in the question),
it would be highly unlikely to work.

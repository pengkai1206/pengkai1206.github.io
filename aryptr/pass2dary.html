<p>
<font face=Helvetica size=8 color=blue><b>Q:</b></font>
My compiler complained when I passed a two-dimensional array to a
function expecting a pointer to a pointer.
</p><p><hr>
<p>
<font face=Helvetica size=8 color=blue><b>A:</b></font>
The rule
(see question <a href="aryptrequiv.html">6.3</a>)
by which arrays decay into pointers is
<em>not</em>
applied recursively.

(Once the rule has been applied once,
the result is a pointer to which the rule no longer applies.)
An array of arrays (i.e. a two-dimensional array in C) decays
into a pointer to an array, not a pointer to a pointer.
Pointers to arrays can be confusing,
and must be treated carefully;
see also question <a href="ptrtoarray.html">6.13</a>.
</p><p>If you are passing a two-dimensional array to a function:
<pre>
	int array[NROWS][NCOLUMNS];
	f(array);
</pre>
the function's declaration
must match:
<pre>
	void f(int a[][NCOLUMNS])
	{ ... }
</pre>
or
<pre>
	void f(int (*ap)[NCOLUMNS])	/* ap is a pointer to an array */
	{ ... }
</pre>
In the first declaration,

the compiler performs the usual
implicit parameter rewriting
of ``array of array''
to ``pointer to array''
(see questions
<a href="aryptrequiv.html">6.3</a>
and
<a href="aryptrparam.html">6.4</a>);
in the second form the pointer declaration is explicit.
Since the called function does not allocate space for the array,
it does not need to know the overall size,
so the number of
rows,

<TT>NROWS</TT>,
can be omitted.
The
width
of the array is still important,
so the
column

dimension
<TT>NCOLUMNS</TT>
(and, for three- or more dimensional arrays,
the intervening ones)
must be
retained.
</p><p>If a function is already declared as accepting a
pointer to a pointer,
it is
almost certainly
meaningless
to pass a two-dimensional array directly to it.
An intermediate pointer would have to be used when attempting to call it
with a two-dimensional array:
<pre>
	extern g(int **ipp);

	int *ip = &amp;array[0][0];
	g(&amp;ip);		/* PROBABLY WRONG */
</pre>
but
this usage is
misleading
and almost certainly
incorrect,
since the array has been ``flattened''
(its shape has been lost).

<p>
<font face=Helvetica size=8 color=blue><b>Q:</b></font>
Why do people use explicit masks and
bit-twiddling
code so much,
instead of declaring bit-fields?
</p><p><hr>
<p>
<font face=Helvetica size=8 color=blue><b>A:</b></font>
Bit-fields are thought to be nonportable,
although they are no less portable
than other parts of the language.
(You don't know how big they can be,
but that's equally true for values of type <TT>int</TT>.
You don't know by default whether they're signed,
but that's equally true of type <TT>char</TT>.
You don't know
whether they're laid out from left to right or right to left in 
memory,
but that's equally true of the bytes
of <em>all</em> types,
and only matters if you're trying to
conform to externally-imposed storage layouts,
which is always nonportable;
see also questions
<a href="padding.html">2.12</a> 
and
<a href="../misc/binaryfiles.html">20.5</a>.)
</p><p>Bit-fields are inconvenient
when you also want to be able to
manipulate some collection of bits as a whole
(perhaps to copy a set of flags).
You can't have arrays of bit-fields;
see also question <a href="../misc/bitsets.html">20.8</a>.
Many programmers suspect that the compiler won't generate good
code for bit-fields (historically, this was sometimes true).
</p><p>
Straightforward code using
bit-fields is certainly clearer
than the equivalent explicit masking instructions;
it's too bad
that
bit-fields can't be used more often.

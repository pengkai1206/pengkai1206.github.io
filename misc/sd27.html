[This was posted by Alan Watson back in 1996,
passing on a suggestion by Mark Brader.
Dik Winter believes that the original idea was due to Karl Heuer.]
<br>
<br>
For this purpose, probably the best thing is some creative use of macros.
(I wish I could remember who invented this little trick.)  You can write
the 16-bit binary number 1100110011110000 as
<pre>
	B16( X X O O X X O O X X X X O O O O )
</pre>
if you first define
<pre>
 	#define X &lt;&lt;1)+1
 	#define O &lt;&lt;1)
 	/* the argument of B16 must be a total of 16 occurrences of
 	   one or the other of the above two macros, effectively
 	   expressing a number in binary */
 	#define B16(arg) (((((((((((((((((0 arg)
</pre>
 
For visual purposes it may be even better to use _ as the name for the
zero-bit, rather than O; but there's a loss of portability then, since
the identifier _ is in the C implementation's name space and therefore
may be used for some purpose in some implementations.  Another good
choice would be o, which suggests 0 without looking quite so much like it.
<br>
<br>
If you're using an unsigned type for the bitmap, as one normally should,
then cast the 0 to that type inside the definition of the macro B16.

how to swap two values without using a third object.]

&gt; I have a question for you :
<br>
&gt;    I need to swap the value of two scalar's without using a third object.
<p>
There are two possible reasons you might be asking me this question:
<br>
1. This requirement is part of some project concerning your employment.
<br>
2. This is a homework or examination question.
<p>
If the former, please go back and convince the architect or
manager who has imposed this requirement to reconsider.  The
trick for swapping values without using temporaries is useful
only in assembly language, when for some reason registers are in
short supply.  The trick has no place in a higher-level language
such as C, because temporary variables are essentially free.
If
you're using C, the right way to swap two
values <TT>a</TT> and <TT>b</TT> is to use a temporary <TT>t</TT>:
<p>
<pre>
	t = a;
	a = b;
	b = t;
</pre>
<p>
Using the trick would only make your program slightly larger,
slightly slower, and slightly harder to understand.
<p>
If the latter, I normally do not give people the answers to
homework problems, but since this question is
ill-advised, I'm willing to make an exception.
<p>
If <TT>a</TT> and <TT>b</TT> are integers, you can swap them by using this curious
set of exclusive-or operations:
<p>
<pre>
	a ^= b;
	b ^= a;
	a ^= b;
</pre>
<p>
But this works only if <TT>a</TT> and <TT>b</TT> are integers, and it has an
additional disadvantage, which is that if for some reason you
have pointers to the integers you want to swap, such that you're
tempted to write
<p>
<pre>
	*p1 ^= *p2;
	*p2 ^= *p1;
	*p1 ^= *p2;
</pre>
<p>
then in the case where <TT>p1 == p2</TT>, you'll zero out both <TT>*p1</TT>
and <TT>*p2</TT>. (The case could arise if you wrote something like
<pre>
	swap(&amp;a[i], &amp;b[j]);
</pre>
in the context of a sorting routine, and <TT>i==j</TT>.)
<p>
If <TT>a</TT> and <TT>b</TT> are floating-point variables, I think there are
triple sequences of additions and subtractions which will
accomplish a swap, but they're all subject to overflow.
<p>
Again, these ``tricks,'' even if they work, are likely to be
significantly slower and bulkier than the obvious three-assignment
swap using a temporary.  These tricks are intellectual
curiosities only; they offer no advantages over the more obvious
swap; they have virtually no place in modern programming.
<p>
If, in fact, this was a homework question,
please request your instructor not to assign it in the future.
It is essentially meaningless and misleading; it serves mostly to
induce students to use these tricks in real programs, where they
have no place.
Also, if your instructor offers as a
solution to this question the version of the exclusive-or trick
expressed as
<p>
<pre>
	a ^= b ^= a ^= b;
</pre>
please inform your instructor that this expression is undefined
in C.

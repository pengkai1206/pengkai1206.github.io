[Someone asked me what the
``big controversy, question, secret, or otherwise in this question''
was,
correctly noting that the answer is somewhat wishy-washy,
and wondering what the point of the question was.
This was my reply.]

[The point of the question is]
Mostly trying to lay an old, recurring flame war to rest.
<p>
Part 1 of the story is that, once upon a time, someone allegedly
discovered that many programs malloc far more memory than they
ever actually use.  But the kernel has to allocate VM (physical
memory and/or backing store in swap space) for the memory anyway,
because of course the program <em>might</em> use it; the kernel has no
way of knowing.  This can (and this is still ``allegedly''; I
haven't personally seen these reports) lead to lots of ``wasted''
swap space, with deleterious effects if swap space is prematurely
exhausted.
<p>
Part 2 of the story is that some versions of Unix (I believe
including AIX and IRIX) have adopted a ``lazy'' allocation
strategy.  When a program calls malloc (or, more precisely, when
malloc calls brk to extend the program's data space), the kernel
does <em>not</em> actually allocate any memory right away, neither in
physical memory nor swap space.  <em>If</em> the program tries to use
the memory, a page fault results, and when handling it, the
kernel discovers that there's no backing store for that page yet,
and allocates it on the fly.
<p>
But part 3 of the story is that there's a potential problem here:
what if, at that point, there isn't any free swap space to be
had?  The kernel is now in a bind: it has promised the calling
program it can use the memory (that promise was made when the
call to malloc/brk succeeded), but now the kernel might have to
renege on that promise.
<p>
Part 4 of the story is that, under kernels which support this
``lazy'' allocation strategy, there's a new signal or two which
the kernel can send.  It can, in effect, say to a process:
``Oh, shoot, I'm out of swap space, deal with it somehow''.
There may be two of these signals, one nonfatal one which
requests that the program deallocate some memory somewhere
to free up some swap space so that the kernel can satisfy the
page fault, and a second, fatal one which is sent after the
reclamation attempts fail.  It's not clear to me whether these
signals are sent to the process which has just suffered the
unsatisfiable page fault, or to some <em>other</em> process that the
kernel would like to swipe some memory or swap space back from.
<p>
Part 5 of the story is that there are some people (myself
included) who think that this is a lousy strategy, no matter how
well-intentioned it is or how real the overallocated-unused swap
space problem was.  When malloc succeeds, it means I've got the
memory, darn it, and if I later get killed by a signal because
the kernel ``overbooked the flight'', so to speak, I'm seriously
annoyed.  Sure, I could catch the relevant signals to protect
myself (i.e., at the very least, to save any vital in-memory
data to disk before the second, fatal signal kills me), but
that's a surprising, non-default thing for me to have to do,
and unfortunately the default on such a system, if I don't go out
of my way to protect myself (or if I don't even know I have to)
seems to be that I can lose.
<p>
People who dislike the lazy allocation strategy would like to
be able to point at the C Standard and say, ``Look, if malloc
succeeds, I'm supposed to be able to use that memory; a
conforming implementation isn't allowed to renege on the
promise.''  But part 6 of the story is that the defenders of the
lazy allocation strategy can themselves point at the Standard
and say, ``Look, there's nothing in there disallowing it''.
And they're right.

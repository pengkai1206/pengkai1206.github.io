I recently
encountered a new technique: the <TT>error()</TT> function as called seems
to accept a single first argument which is a severity level, but
it is not passed as a simple integer, but rather as a macro of
the form <TT>LV1</TT>, <TT>LV2</TT>, <TT>LV3</TT>, etc., where each macro is defined as a
triple, e.g. <TT>LV1</TT> is <TT>__FILE__,__LINE__,1</TT>.

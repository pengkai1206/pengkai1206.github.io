<p>
<font face=Helvetica size=8 color=blue><b>Q:</b></font>
My floating-point calculations are acting strangely and giving me
different answers on different machines.

First,
see question <a href="fpdecl.html">14.2</a>.
</p><p>If the problem isn't that simple,
recall that
digital computers
usually
use floating-point formats which provide a
close but by no means exact simulation of real number arithmetic.
Among other things, the associative and distributive
laws do not
hold completely;

that is,
order of operation may be important,
and
repeated addition is not necessarily equivalent to multiplication.
Underflow,
cumulative precision loss,
and other anomalies are often troublesome.
</p><p>Don't assume that floating-point results will be exact,
and especially don't assume that floating-point values can be
compared for equality.
(Don't throw haphazard ``fuzz factors'' in, either;
see question <a href="fpequal.html">14.5</a>.)
Beware that some machines have more precision available
in
floating-point computation registers
than in <TT>double</TT> values stored in memory,
which can lead
to floating-point inequalities
when it would seem that two values just
<em>have</em>
to be equal.


</p><p>These problems are
no
worse for C than they are for any other
computer language.

Certain aspects of
floating-point
are usually defined as ``however
the processor does them''
(see also questions
<a href="../ansi/undef.html">11.33</a> and
<a href="../ansi/appalled.html">11.34</a>),
otherwise a compiler for a machine without the ``right''
model would have to do prohibitively expensive emulations.
</p><p>This document cannot begin to list the pitfalls associated with,
and workarounds appropriate for, floating-point work.
A good
numerical
programming text should cover the basics;
see also the references below.
(Beware, though, that subtle problems can occupy numerical analysts for
years.)

<br>
&gt; in increasing order they appear in the struct template.
<br>
&gt; Is this abusing the C standard? I note that the X11 Xt

<br>
&gt; BTW, I didn't find this one the FAQ.

&gt;
<br>
&gt; typedef struct {
<br>
&gt;   int x,y;
<br>
&gt; } POINT;
<br>
&gt;
<br>
&gt; typedef struct {
<br>
&gt;   POINT center;
<br>
&gt;   int radius;
<br>
&gt; } CIRCLE;
<br>
&gt;
<br>
&gt; void setLocation(POINT *p, int x, int y) {
<br>
&gt;   p-&gt;x = x;
<br>
&gt;   p-&gt;y = y;
<br>
&gt; }
<br>
&gt;
<br>
&gt; CIRCLE c;
<br>
&gt; setLocation(&amp;c, 10,15);
<p>
Except for the fact that a cast is required
<p>
<pre>
setLocation((POINT *)&amp;c, 10, 15);
</pre>
<p>
this is fine.  ANSI/ISO 9899-1990 6.5.2.1 states that ``a pointer to a
structure object, suitably converted, points to its initial member''.
Hence, a pointer to a CIRCLE in your case can be suitably converted to
point to a POINT.
<p>
This question is becoming a more and more popular question lately.
It may be time to update the FAQ.  Comments and corrections to the
following are welcome.
<p>
Q. How can I implement object-oriented (OO) inheritance in C with
structures?
<p>
A. First, make sure that using an OO language (such as C++) is not a
good option.  The C language was not designed with OO in mind, and
so facilities to support OO programming are limited.  Think through
just what OO features you will need, and think about how you expect
to implement them in C.
<p>
That said, it is possible to implement single inheritance in C by
nesting a structure inside of a structure.  This techniques works
since a pointer to a structure object, when suitably converted,
points to its initial member.  Thus, single inheritance of a ``parent''
structure is accomplished by creating a new ``child'' structure whose
initial member is the same type as the ``parent''.  The following
example (thanks to Wayne O. Cochran) illustrates how this is done.
<p>
<pre>
typedef struct {
  int x;
  int y;
} point;

typedef struct {
  point center;
  int radius;
} circle;

void init_point(point *p, int x, int y)
{
  p-&gt;x = x;
  p-&gt;y = y;
}

void init_circle(circle *c, int x, int y, int r)
{
  init_point((void *)c, x, y);
  c-&gt;radius = r;
}
</pre>
<p>
In this example, we see that `circle' inherits from `point' the
integer members `x' and `y'.  Note that the following function is
invalid
<p>
<pre>
void bad_init_circle(circle *c, int x, int y, int r)
{
  c-&gt;x = x;  /* should be ((point *)c)-&gt;x = x; */
  c-&gt;y = y;  /* should be ((point *)c)-&gt;y = y; */
  c-&gt;radius = r;
}
</pre>
<p>
since the pointer to circle `c' has not yet been suitably converted
to point to the type of its first member.

It's likely that you've never tried to call <TT>scanf</TT> and <TT>gets</TT> in the
same program.  If you haven't, you're blissfully unaware of this
messy little problem.
<p>
Suppose you write this trivial program:
<p>
<pre>
	#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;
	int main()
	{
		int i;
		char string[80];
		printf("enter an integer:\n");
		scanf("%d", &amp;i);
		printf("enter a string:\n");
		gets(string);
		printf("You typed %d and \"%s\"\n", i, string);
		return 0;
	}
</pre>
<p>
Looks perfectly straightforward, right?  But if you compile and
run it (which I encourage you to do, if you're still unfamiliar
with this problem), you'll see something weird, and you will
find yourself (I guarantee it) asking <a href="scanfinterlace.html">question 12.18</a> in the
comp.lang.c FAQ list: &ldquo;I'm reading a number with <TT>scanf&nbsp;%d</TT> and
then a string with <TT>gets()</TT>, but the compiler seems to be skipping
the call to <TT>gets()</TT>!&rdquo;  (We'll have more to say later about using
<TT>gets</TT> at all, but hold that thought.)
<p>
Let's look very carefully at what happens.  The first <TT>printf</TT> call
prints the first prompt, and we type &ldquo;<TT>123</TT>&rdquo; and hit the return
key.  The input stream now contains
<pre>
	1 2 3 \n
</pre>
Now we hit the <TT>scanf</TT> call, and <TT>scanf</TT> sees the format string <TT>%d</TT>
indicating that we've asked it to read an int.  It reads the
character '<TT>1</TT>' from the input stream and says to itself &ldquo;okay,
that's a digit, so it can be part of an int.&rdquo;  It reads the
characters '<TT>2</TT>' and '<TT>3</TT>', and they're digits, too.  The next
character is '<TT>\n</TT>', which is not a digit.  So <TT>scanf</TT> does two
things:
<ol>
<p>
<li>
It terminates processing of the <TT>%d</TT> directive; it now
knows that the complete integer it has read is 123;
it stores this value as requested into the location
of the variable <TT>i</TT>.
<p>
<li>
(This is the key point.)  It pushes the <TT>\n</TT> character,
which terminated the digit string but which it didn't
otherwise use, back onto the input stream.
</ol>
<p>
So after the first <TT>scanf</TT> call, the input stream contains
<pre>
	\n
</pre>
Now the second <TT>printf</TT> call prints the second prompt.  Suppose we
type &ldquo;<TT>test</TT>&rdquo; and hit the enter key.  The input stream now contains
<pre>
	\n t e s t \n
</pre>
So now we come to the <TT>gets</TT> call.  <TT>gets</TT>'s job, of course, is to
read one line of input, up to the next newline.  But the very
first character gets sees is a <TT>\n</TT>, so as far as it's concerned
it's just read a blank line.  It returns that blank line (an
empty string, since <TT>gets</TT> always deletes the newline from the
line before returning it to you), and the input stream is left
containing
<pre>
	t e s t \n
</pre>
The third <TT>printf</TT> call prints the (somewhat surprising) results
of the two inputs, and the program terminates, with the string
&ldquo;test&rdquo; and the final newline unconsumed.
<p>
If this still isn't quite making sense, try running the program
again, and typing something more than a number in response to the
first prompt.  That is, try typing &ldquo;<TT>123 abc</TT>&rdquo; or &ldquo;<TT>123abc</TT>&rdquo;, and
then hitting the return key, when asked to &ldquo;enter an integer&rdquo;.
<p>
(Actually, the above description isn't quite right.  No matter
what you type on the first line, the input stream after the first
scanf call still contains a \n, so the <TT>gets</TT> call reads it right
away, without pausing for you to enter anything more.  So you
don't really get a chance to type &ldquo;test&rdquo; at all.  To answer the
FAQ list's question another way, the problem is not that the
compiler somehow &ldquo;skips&rdquo; the <TT>gets</TT> call, the problem is that the
<TT>gets</TT> call satisfies its need for input in an unexpected way, and
skips the part about pausing the program to wait for you to type
anything more.)
<p>
With the scenario above as background, we can now answer your
question, &ldquo;Why would you possibly want to discard the user's
input?&rdquo;  For better or worse, many beginning programmers use
<TT>scanf</TT> to read numbers and <TT>gets</TT> to read strings.  This is in large
part, of course, because these functions are taught early in many
books and programming classes.  And this, in turn, is because
these functions are superficially and seductively attractive;
they seem very easy and convenient to use.  But they don't play
at all well together (plus they have some other problems, which
we'll get to).
<p>
When the beginning programmer writes a program like the above
and discovers that it doesn't work quite right, he is likely to
receive the handwaving explanation (from the instructor or the
textbook author) that there is some &ldquo;garbage left behind on the
input stream by <TT>scanf</TT>&rdquo;.  (We, who understand the situation more
accurately, now know that the &ldquo;garbage&rdquo; is, in the example we
walked through, simply the <TT>\n</TT> that resulted from our hitting the
return key after entering the requested number.)  To allow
further input to proceed as expected, these instructors and
authors go on to explain, the &ldquo;garbage&rdquo; must be &ldquo;discarded&rdquo;.
One all-too-popular (and, again, superficially attractive) way of
doing this is to call <TT>fflush(stdin)</TT>, despite the fact that this
is a misguided application of the standard <TT>fflush</TT> function, an
application that is not guaranteed to (and in fact most certainly
does not) work everywhere.  But it &ldquo;works&rdquo; under a large number
of popular PC C compilers, so the &ldquo;idiom&rdquo; is, unfortunately,
widespread.
<p>
What's the right solution?  It's extremely easy to get stuck
on the fact that <TT>fflush(stdin)</TT>, for some presumably stupid
and pedantic reason, is not guaranteed to work everywhere.
One then starts casting about looking for a &ldquo;portable&rdquo;
replacement.  The problem is that, depending on precisely what
one is trying to do, there are quite a few different tacks one
might take in attempting to write some well-defined or portable
code to &ldquo;discard garbage from stdin&rdquo;.  (In the general case, as
you correctly ask, &ldquo;How in the world would [one] know what part
to discard?&rdquo;)
<p>
If the definition of the &ldquo;garbage from stdin&rdquo; that we're trying
to discard is &ldquo;input from the previous line which wasn't consumed
by <TT>scanf</TT>&rdquo;, it turns out that there are a couple of not entirely
unreasonable approaches.  We could write the loop
<p>
<pre>
	while((c = getchar()) != '\n' &amp;&amp; c != EOF)
		/* discard the character */;
</pre>
<p>
to read and discard characters up to the next newline.  (Notice
that the comment &ldquo;<TT>/*&nbsp;discard the character&nbsp;*/</TT>&rdquo; in this fragment
does not stand in for some code I didn't write yet -- it stands
in for some code I deliberately didn't write at all.  The body of
the loop is empty; we do nothing with the characters we're
reading, thus discarding them.  The <TT>\n</TT> which terminates the
loop is discarded, too.)
<p>
Since that loop would clutter our code pretty badly if we had
to interpose it after every <TT>scanf</TT> call, we might encapsulate it
into a function we could call, perhaps called &ldquo;flushline&rdquo; or
something.  Or, recognizing that &ldquo;read characters up to a
newline&rdquo; is precisely what the Standard functions <TT>gets</TT> and <TT>fgets</TT>
already do, we might simply interpose calls to <TT>gets</TT> or <TT>fgets</TT>,
reading into a dummy buffer which we ignore (and hence discard),
perhaps accompanied by comments explaining that these dummy calls
are to &ldquo;get rid of the garbage left behind by scanf&rdquo;.  But these
are still ugly, unclean, unsatisfying solutions.  It won't be
long before one of our scanf calls, for some reason, <em>does</em>
consume a newline character after all, such that our compensating
&ldquo;read and discard characters up to the next newline&rdquo; code will
read and discard the next line of input, a real line of input,
which will then be lost to the input-reading code which expected
it.  We could try to predict which <TT>scanf</TT> calls will and which
<TT>scanf</TT> calls won't leave &ldquo;garbage behind&rdquo;, and sprinkle &ldquo;flushline&rdquo;
calls after only those <TT>scanf</TT> calls which need them, but this is a
hit-or-miss proposition, and a later reader will never be able to
understand precisely what we're up to.  There's got to be a
better way.
<p>
The &ldquo;better way&rdquo;, as indicated in the FAQ list, is either to
abandon <TT>scanf</TT> entirely, or to use it exclusively.  If your
input is intended to be line-based, you can read <em>all</em> lines
of input as strings, using <TT>fgets</TT> or the like, and for those
that were supposed to be numeric, convert the strings to numbers
using functions like <TT>atoi</TT>, <TT>strtol</TT>, <TT>atof</TT>, or maybe even <TT>sscanf</TT>.
(This is the general approach I recommend.)  Or, since the
problem is that it's <TT>scanf</TT> that does Not Play Well With Others,
you can switch to a scheme where you use <TT>scanf</TT> for everything,
using it to read your strings, too (with <TT>%s</TT> or the like).
<p>
Finally, I should add a couple of postscripts.  It turns out
that <TT>scanf</TT> has other problems besides the fact that it tends to
leave little undigested &ldquo;surprises&rdquo; on the input stream, so there
are other reasons to consider abandoning it.  And, of course,
as discussed at length in comp.lang.c of late, <TT>gets</TT> has a fatal
problem which counterindicates its use for much of anything.

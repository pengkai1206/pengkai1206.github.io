<p>
<font face=Helvetica size=8 color=blue><b>Q:</b></font>
Why isn't there a numbered, multi-level <TT>break</TT> statement
to break out of several loops at once?
What am I supposed to use instead, a <TT>goto</TT>?
</p><p><hr>
<p>
<font face=Helvetica size=8 color=blue><b>A:</b></font>
First, remember why it is that <TT>break</TT> and <TT>continue</TT>
exist at all--they are,
in effect, ``structured <TT>goto</TT>s''
used in preference to <TT>goto</TT>
(and accepted as alternatives by most of those who shun <TT>goto</TT>)
because they are clean and structured and
pretty much
restricted to a common, idiomatic usages.
A hypothetical multi-level <TT>break</TT>, on the other hand,
would rapidly lose the inherent cleanliness of the single
<TT>break</TT>--programmers and readers of code
would have to carefully count nesting levels
to figure out what a given <TT>break</TT> did,
and the insertion of a new intermediately-nested loop
could, er, break things badly.
(By this analysis,
a numbered <TT>break</TT> statement can
be even more confusing and error-prone than a <TT>goto</TT>/label pair.)
</p><p>The right way to break out of several loops at once
(which C also does not have)
involves a syntax which allows the naming of loops,
so that a <TT>break</TT> statement can specify
the name of the loop to be broken out of.
</p><p>If you do have to break out of more than one loop at once
(or break out of a loop from inside a switch,
where <TT>break</TT> would merely end a <TT>case</TT> label)
yes, go ahead and use a <TT>goto</TT>.
(But when you find the need for a multi-level break,
it's often a sign that the loop should be broken out to its own function,
at which point you can achieve roughly the same effect
as that multi-level break
by using a premature return.)

What is ``Duff's Device''?

<font face=Helvetica size=8 color=blue><b>A:</b></font>

It's
a devastatingly
devious way of
unrolling a loop,
devised by Tom Duff while he was at Lucasfilm.
In its ``classic''
form,
it was used to copy bytes,
and
looked
like this:
<pre>
	register n = (count + 7) / 8;	/* count &gt; 0 assumed */
	switch (count % 8)
	{
	case 0:	   do { *to = *from++;
	case 7:		*to = *from++;
	case 6:		*to = *from++;
	case 5:		*to = *from++;
	case 4:		*to = *from++;
	case 3:		*to = *from++;
	case 2:		*to = *from++;
	case 1:		*to = *from++;
		      } while (--n &gt; 0);
	}
</pre>

where <TT>count</TT> bytes
are to be copied
from the array pointed to by <TT>from</TT>
to the memory location pointed to by <TT>to</TT>
(which is a memory-mapped device output register,
which is why <TT>to</TT> isn't incremented).
It solves the problem of handling the leftover bytes
(when <TT>count</TT> isn't a multiple of 8)
by interleaving a
<TT>switch</TT> statement
with the loop
which copies bytes 8 at a time.
(Believe it or not, it <em>is</em>
legal
to have <TT>case</TT> labels buried
within blocks
nested in a <TT>switch</TT> statement
like this.
In his announcement of the technique to C's developers and the world,
Duff noted that C's <TT>switch</TT> syntax,
in particular its
``fall through''
behavior,
had long been controversial,
and that
``This code forms some sort of argument in that debate,
but I'm not sure whether it's for or against.'')

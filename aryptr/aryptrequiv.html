<font face=Helvetica size=8 color=blue><b>Q:</b></font>
So what is meant by the ``equivalence of pointers and arrays'' in C?
</p><p><hr>
<p>
<font face=Helvetica size=8 color=blue><b>A:</b></font>
Much of the confusion surrounding
arrays and
pointers in C can be traced to
a misunderstanding of
this statement.
Saying that arrays and pointers are ``equivalent''
means
neither
that they are
identical
nor
even
interchangeable.
What it means is that array and pointer arithmetic is defined
such that a pointer can be conveniently used
to access an array
or to simulate an array.
In other words, as Wayne Throop has put it,
it's




``pointer <em>arithmetic</em> and array <em>indexing</em>
[that]
are equivalent in C, pointers and arrays are <em>different</em>.'')
</p><p>Specifically,
the cornerstone of the equivalence is this
key definition:
<blockquote>A reference to an object

of type array-of-T
which appears in an
expression
decays

(with three exceptions)
into a pointer to its first element;
the type of the resultant pointer is pointer-to-T.
</blockquote></p><p>That is,
whenever an array appears in an expression,
the compiler implicitly generates a pointer to the array's
first element,
just as if the programmer had written <TT>&amp;a[0]</TT>.
(The exceptions are when the array is the operand of
a <TT>sizeof</TT>
or
<TT>&amp;</TT>
operator,
or is a string literal initializer for a character
array.
<a href="stringw.html" rel=subdocument>[footnote]</a>
See questions
<a href="arraynels.html">6.23</a>,
<a href="aryvsadr.html">6.12</a>,
and
<a href="../decl/strlitinit.html">1.32</a>,
respectively.)
</p><p>As a consequence of
this definition,
and in spite of the fact that
the underlying arrays and pointers are quite different,
the compiler doesn't apply the array subscripting operator
<TT>[]</TT>
that differently
to arrays and pointers,
after all.<a href="fn28.html" rel=subdocument>[footnote]</a>

Given an array <TT>a</TT> and pointer <TT>p</TT>,
an expression of the form <TT>a[i]</TT>
causes the array to decay
into a pointer,
following the rule above,
and
then to be
subscripted just as would be a pointer variable in
the expression <TT>p[i]</TT>
(although the eventual memory accesses will be different,
as explained in question
<a href="aryptr2.html">6.2</a>).
If you were to assign the array's address to the pointer:
<pre>
	p = a;
</pre>



then <TT>p[3]</TT> and <TT>a[3]</TT> would access the same element.
</p><p>This
harmony

of access explains how pointers can access arrays,
serve in their stead as function parameters
(see question <a href="aryptrparam.html">6.4</a>),
and simulate dynamic arrays
(see question <a href="dynarray.html">6.14</a>).
</p><p>See also 
questions <a href="practdiff.html">6.8</a>, <a href="ptrkindofary.html">6.10</a>, and <a href="dynarray.html">6.14</a>.

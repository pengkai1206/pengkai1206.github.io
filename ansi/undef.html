<p>
<font face=Helvetica size=8 color=blue><b>Q:</b></font>
People seem to make a point of distinguishing
between
implementation-defined,
unspecified,
and
undefined
behavior.
What do these mean?
</p><p><hr>
<p>
<font face=Helvetica size=8 color=blue><b>A:</b></font>
First of all,
all

three of these represent areas
in which the C Standard
does <em>not</em> specify exactly what a particular construct,
or a program which uses it,
must do.
This looseness in C's definition is traditional and deliberate:
it permits compiler writers to
(a)
make

choices
which allow efficient code to be generated
by arranging that various constructs
are implemented as ``however the hardware does them''
(see also question <a href="../fp/strangefp.html">14.4a</a>),
and
(b)
ignore
(that is,
avoid worrying about
generating correct code for)
certain marginal constructs
which are
too difficult to define precisely
and which probably aren't useful to well-written programs anyway
(see for example
the code fragments in
questions
<a href="../expr/evalorder1.html">3.1</a>,
<a href="../expr/evalorder2.html">3.2</a>,
and
<a href="../expr/ieqiplusplus.html">3.3</a>).
</p><p>These three variations on
``not precisely defined by the standard''
are defined as:
</p><p><b>implementation-defined:</b>
The implementation must pick some behavior;
it may not fail to compile the program.
(The program using the construct is not incorrect.)
The choice must be documented.
The Standard may specify
a set of allowable behaviors
from which to choose,
or it may impose no particular requirements.
</p><p><b>unspecified:</b>
Like implementation-defined,
except that the choice need not be documented.
</p><p><b>undefined:</b>
Anything at all can happen;
the Standard imposes no requirements.
The program may fail to compile,
or it may execute incorrectly
(either crashing or silently generating incorrect results),
or it may fortuitously do exactly what the programmer intended.
</p><p>Note, too,
that since the Standard imposes
absolutely no
requirements
on the behavior of a compiler faced with an instance of undefined behavior,
the compiler
(more importantly, any generated code)
can do absolutely anything.
In particular,
there is no guarantee
that
at most
the undefined bit of the program will behave badly,
and
that the rest of the program will perform normally.
It's perilous
to think that you can tolerate undefined behavior
in a
program,
imagining that its undefinedness can't hurt;
the undefined behavior can be more undefined than you think it can.
(See
question <a href="../expr/evalorder2.html">3.2</a>
for a relatively simple

example.)
</p><p>Since many people seem to have trouble
comprehending the depths to which undefined behavor can descend,

it is traditional to come up with eye-catching, outrageous examples.
Undefined means that,
notwithstanding question <a href="../bool/bool2.html">9.2</a>,
<TT>printf("%d",&nbsp;j++&nbsp;&lt;=&nbsp;j);</TT>
can print 42, or ``forty-two.''


</p><p>If you're
interested in
writing portable code,
you can
ignore the distinctions,
as you'll
usually
want to avoid code that depends on any of the three behaviors.
</p><p>See also questions
<a href="../expr/evalorder4.html">3.9</a>,
and
<a href="appalled.html">11.34</a>.
</p><p>(A fourth defined class of not-quite-precisely-defined behavior,
without the same stigma attached to it,
is <a href="../sx1/index.html#locale-specific"><dfn>locale-specific</dfn></a>.)

As others have doubtless noted, the actual standard
as well as K&amp;R 2 are deliberately even more vague
about this issue.   The standard presumably wants
to avoid forcing the existence of and defining the
semantics of directories, the notion of .., whether
/ or \ or something else is used as a separator
in file names, etc. etc.
<p>
Most of the solutions people have come up with
are presumably consistent with the standard and
so the question is what is the most useful convention.
I suppose there are two general theories about this.
<p>
One is that relative "..." includes are relative to the original
source file, the other is that they are relative to the file
in which they appear.  On the whole I have become persuaded
that the first interpretation is more useful and easier
to understand.  It caters to the situation I've met most
frequently, where one wants to compile some complicated
system from afar--source and associated headers in some
distant place, but I don't want to have to read them
to discover their inclusion relationships.
<p>
Of course the systems that do have directories often
implement <TT>-I</TT> directives, which (depending on how you
look at it) either save you because you can control
the search, or introduce further confusion because you
sometimes have to figure out what <TT>-I</TT> things are needed.

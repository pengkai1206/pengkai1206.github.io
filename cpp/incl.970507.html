on the difference between <TT>#include&nbsp;""</TT>

and strategies for using them;

&gt; Which is more maintainable, using angle brackets with the <TT>#include</TT>
<br>
&gt; preprocessor directive or using the quotes?
<p>
They each have their uses.  For Standard headers, you always
want to use angle brackets.  For your own headers pertaining
to a single, self-contained program, you almost always want
to use double quotes.  For third-party headers, or your own
headers describing libraries which you use in multiple or
large projects, there are viable (and acceptable) strategies
involving either angle brackets or double quotes (along with
whatever mechanisms your compiler provides for augmenting the
header file search path(s)).
<p>
&gt; Also, is the interpretation of the quotes system dependent?  That is,
<br>
&gt; can the preprocessor interpretation of ``current directory'' differ from 
<br>
&gt; system to system?
<p>
Yes, very much so.  In particular, for some compilers/preprocessors,
the ``current directory'' is always the directory
from which you invoked the compiler, but for others, it's the
directory in which the file doing the <TT>#include</TT> resides (in other
words, the directory containing the file containing the <TT>#include</TT>
directive).  This latter strategy, though less obvious, is often
exactly what you want (except, of course, when it isn't; it can
be a real nuisance under certain circumstances [<a href="incl.970507.html#footnote">footnote</a>]).
<p>
&gt; I can not get any insight to this from the FAQ.

Question 10.8 mentions some of what I've discussed here.

<a name="footnote">[*]</a> For example, if you're working on a large, multi-person
project, and if there are central directories where the official
or at least main-line development versions of source and header
files reside, and individual ``playpen'' directories where each
team member works with files prior to checking them back in to
the main source tree, and if header files can <TT>#include</TT> other
header files, and if you've just checked out a header file into
your own ``playpen'' include directory, modified it, and then
recompiled, only to have your changes <em>not</em> take effect, it's
likely that the header file you modified is included, using
double quotes, by another header file, and that other header file
exists only in the central include directory, so that when any
other source file included that other header, the preprocessor
retrieved the mainstream, unmodified version of that header, from
the same ``current'' mainstream include directory, rather than the
one you just modified.  In this case, you may have to check out a
copy of that other header file, too, even though you have no need
to modify it, just so it will be sitting in your private include
directory, for other inclusions to find first and so that the
secondary header file it includes will be your modified copy.
<p>
I suppose this is another argument against nested include files.
On the other hand, the problem as I've stated it only comes up if
you use double quotes.  If you use angle brackets for the central
project header files (in particular, for nested inclusions of
central project header files), the preprocessor never starts at
the wrong ``current'' directory, but always traverses the search
path from the start again, and finds the one in your private
include directory, as you wanted, regardless.

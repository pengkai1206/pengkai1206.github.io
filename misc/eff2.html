<p>
<font face=Helvetica size=8 color=blue><b>Q:</b></font>
Are pointers really faster than arrays?
How much do function calls slow things down?
Is <TT>++i</TT> faster than <TT>i&nbsp;=&nbsp;i&nbsp;+&nbsp;1</TT>?
</p><p><hr>

Precise answers to these and many similar questions
depend
of course
on the processor and compiler in use.
If you simply must know,
you'll have to time test programs carefully.
(Often the differences are so slight that
hundreds of
thousands of iterations are required even to see them.
<a href="subtle.html" rel=subdocument>[footnote]</a>
Check the compiler's assembly language output,
if available,
to see if two
purported alternatives aren't compiled identically.)
</p><p>For conventional machines,
it is usually
faster to march through large arrays with
pointers rather than array subscripts,
but for some processors the reverse is true.
(Better compilers should
generate good code
regardless of which notation you use,
though





it's arguably easier for a compiler
to convert array indices to pointers than vice versa<a href="fn98.html" rel=subdocument>[footnote]</a>
.)
</p><p>Function calls,
though obviously incrementally slower than in-line code,
contribute so much to modularity and code clarity
that there is rarely good reason to avoid them.
(Actually, by reducing bulk,
functions can improve performance.)
Also,



some compilers are able to expand
small, critical-path functions
in-line,
either as an optimization or at the programmer's request.
</p><p>Before rearranging expressions such as <TT>i&nbsp;=&nbsp;i&nbsp;+&nbsp;1</TT>,
remember that you are dealing with a compiler,
not a keystroke-programmable calculator.
Any decent compiler
will generate identical code for <TT>++i</TT>, <TT>i&nbsp;+=&nbsp;1</TT>,
and <TT>i&nbsp;=&nbsp;i&nbsp;+&nbsp;1</TT>.
The reasons for using <TT>++i</TT> or <TT>i&nbsp;+=&nbsp;1</TT> over <TT>i&nbsp;=&nbsp;i&nbsp;+&nbsp;1</TT>
have to do with style, not efficiency.

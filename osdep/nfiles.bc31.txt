Steve - I've been lurking/posting for about a year now.  I see a
possibility for a new FAQ and answer -- although it's a little off
topic.

Q: I'm trying to open more than 20 files using Borland c 3.x and I can't
do it.  My CONFIG.SYS has FILES=30.

A: (from the Borland C vers 3.1 (DOS) readme file
  - You can now increase the number of files that can be open
    at one time in a DOS program by a simple modification of the
    runtime library.

    First, modify _NFILE.H in your INCLUDE directory by changing
    the #define for _NFILE_:

       #define _NFILE_ n

    where n is the number of files you want to open. Make sure the
    FILES statement in your CONFIG.SYS file specifies at least
    this number.

    Then compile the two files FILES.C and FILES2.C in the LIB
    directory:

       BCC -c -m<model> files.c files2.c

    where <model> is the memory model you're using.

    Then link them directly with the program which opens the files,
    for instance:

       BCC myfile.c files.obj files2.obj

    If you want the change to apply to all modules, add
    FILES.OBJ and FILES2.OBJ created above to the libraries
    you use; from the LIB directory, type:

       TLIB c<model> +-files.obj +-files2.obj

    where <model> matches what you used for the BCC command
    above.

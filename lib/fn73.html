It's worth saying a few words about
the range of dates that can be represented as <TT>time_t</TT>'s.
A very common <TT>time_t</TT> representation
(based on Unix and Posix)
is the number of seconds since
midnight (GMT), January 1, 1970.
If <TT>time_t</TT> is a 32-bit integer,
the range is therefore
from 1970
until at least January 18, 2038,
plus perhaps another 68 years before 1970 or after 2038
depending on whether <TT>time_t</TT> is signed or unsigned.
If <TT>time_t</TT> is a 64-bit integer,
the range is nearly infinite.
However,
<TT>time_t</TT> is <em>not</em> required to be represented
as the number of seconds since 1970;
some systems

use different epoch values,
or may use different representations entirely.

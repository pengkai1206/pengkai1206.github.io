</h1>
<p>
<font face=Helvetica size=8 color=blue><b>Q:</b></font>
If the assignment operator were <TT>:=</TT>,
wouldn't it then be harder to accidentally write things like
<TT>if(a&nbsp;=&nbsp;b)</TT> ?
</p><p><hr>
<p>
<font face=Helvetica size=8 color=blue><b>A:</b></font>
Yes, but it would also be
just a
little bit
more cumbersome

to type all of the assignment statements
which a typical program contains.
</p><p>In any case,
it's really too late to be worrying about this sort of thing now.
The choices of <TT>=</TT> for assignment and <TT>==</TT> for comparison
were made,
rightly or wrongly,
over two decades ago,
and are not likely to be changed.
(With respect to the question,
many compilers and versions of <TT>lint</TT>
will warn about <TT>if(a&nbsp;=&nbsp;b)</TT>
and similar expressions;
see also question <a href="../style/revtest.html">17.4</a>.)
</p><p>As a point of historical interest,
the choices were made based on the observation that assignment
is more frequent than comparison,
and so deserves fewer keystrokes.
In fact,
using <TT>=</TT> for assignment in



C and its predecessor B
represented a change from
B's own predecessor
BCPL,
which did use <TT>:=</TT>
as its assignment operator.

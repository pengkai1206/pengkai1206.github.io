Hi Steve,
<p>
Sorry this took so long; it's been really crazy around here.  The 
machine that crashed is a Toshiba Satellite T2400CT with a 486/66 running 
Windows 3.1.1.  The compiler is Borland C++ 4.0, installed to run strict 
ANSI C.  The symptom is simple: you compile the program, and run it, and 
you get a syntax error -- from the <em>linker</em>!  Changing <TT>void</TT> to <TT>int</TT>
dispels the problem immediately.  Of course, since apparently Borland 
defaults to strict ANSI compliance (my coworker did not specify strict 
ANSI mode) there is no way to run most of Borland's own example code 
without reinstalling the compiler...
<p>
This isn't quite as exciting as I originally thought it was, but it's a 
beautiful example of undefined behavior on the platform where void main() 
is "supposed" to be "good style," using one of the compilers that 
advocates that style.
<p>
Hope this is worth something.  I was kind of hoping that it actually 
hung the machine like my colleague let on, but a linker syntax error is a 
pretty satisfying crash. :)

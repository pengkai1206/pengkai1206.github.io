<font face=Helvetica size=8 color=blue><b>Q:</b></font>
Now I'm trying to sort an array of structures
with <TT>qsort</TT>.
My comparison function takes pointers to structures,
but the compiler
complains
that the function is
of the wrong type for <TT>qsort</TT>.
How can I cast the function pointer to shut off the warning?
</p><p><hr>

The
conversions
must be in the
comparison function,
which
must be declared as accepting ``generic pointers''
(<TT>const&nbsp;void&nbsp;*</TT>)
as discussed
in question
<a href="qsort1.html">13.8</a> 
above.
For a hypothetical
little
date structure
<pre>
struct mystruct {
	int year, month, day;
};
</pre>
the
comparison function
might look like
<a href="compare.html" rel=subdocument>[footnote]</a>

<pre>
int mystructcmp(const void *p1, const void *p2)
{
	const struct mystruct *sp1 = p1;
	const struct mystruct *sp2 = p2;
	if(sp1-&gt;year &lt; sp2-&gt;year) return -1;
	else if(sp1-&gt;year &gt; sp2-&gt;year) return 1;
	else if(sp1-&gt;month &lt; sp2-&gt;month) return -1;
	else if(sp1-&gt;month &gt; sp2-&gt;month) return 1;
	else if(sp1-&gt;day &lt; sp2-&gt;day) return -1;
	else if(sp1-&gt;day &gt; sp2-&gt;day) return 1;
	else return 0;
}
</pre>
(The conversions
from generic pointers
to <TT>struct mystruct</TT> pointers
happen in the initializations
<TT>sp1&nbsp;=&nbsp;p1</TT> and <TT>sp2&nbsp;=&nbsp;p2</TT>;
the compiler performs the
conversions implicitly
since
<TT>p1</TT> and <TT>p2</TT> are
<TT>void</TT> pointers.)

</p><p>For this version of <TT>mystructcmp</TT>,
the call to <TT>qsort</TT> might look like
<pre>
#include &lt;stdlib.h&gt;
struct mystruct dates[NDATES];
int ndates;
/* ndates cells of dates[] are to be sorted */
qsort(dates, ndates, sizeof(struct mystruct), mystructcmp);
</pre>
</p><p>If,
on the other hand,
you're sorting pointers to structures,
you'll need indirection,
as in question
<a href="qsort1.html">13.8</a>;
the
head of
the
comparison function would
look
like
<pre>
int myptrstructcmp(const void *p1, const void *p2)
{
	struct mystruct *sp1 = *(struct mystruct * const *)p1;
	struct mystruct *sp2 = *(struct mystruct * const *)p2;
</pre>
and the call would look like
<pre>
struct mystruct *dateptrs[NDATES];
qsort(dateptrs, ndates, sizeof(struct mystruct *), myptrstructcmp);
</pre>
</p><p>To understand why the curious
pointer conversions
in a <TT>qsort</TT> comparison function are necessary
(and why a cast of the function pointer when calling
<TT>qsort</TT>
can't help),
it's useful to think about how <TT>qsort</TT> works.
<TT>qsort</TT> doesn't know anything about the type or
representation of the data being sorted:
it just shuffles around little chunks of memory.
(All it knows about the chunks is their size,
which you specify
in <TT>qsort</TT>'s third argument.)
To determine whether two chunks need swapping,
<TT>qsort</TT> calls your comparison function.
(To swap them,
it
uses the equivalent of <TT>memcpy</TT>.)
</p><p>Since <TT>qsort</TT> deals in a generic way
with chunks of memory of unknown
type,
it uses generic pointers
(<TT>void&nbsp;*</TT>)

to refer to them.
When <TT>qsort</TT> calls your comparison function,
it passes as arguments
two generic pointers to the chunks to be compared.
Since it passes generic pointers,
your comparison function must
<em>accept</em> generic pointers,
and
convert
the pointers back to their appropriate type
before manipulating them
(i.e. before performing the comparison).
A <TT>void</TT> pointer is not the same type as a structure pointer,
and on some machines it may have a different size or representation
(which is why these casts are required for correctness).
</p><p>If you were sorting an array of structures,
and had a comparison function accepting structure pointers:
<pre>
	int mywrongstructcmp(struct mystruct *, struct mystruct *);
</pre>
and if you called <TT>qsort</TT> as
<pre>
	qsort(dates, ndates, sizeof(struct mystruct),
		(int (*)(const void *, const void *))mywrongstructcmp);
							/* WRONG */
</pre>
the
cast
<TT>(int&nbsp;(*)(const&nbsp;void&nbsp;*, const&nbsp;void&nbsp;*))</TT>
would do nothing
except perhaps
silence the message from the compiler telling you that this
comparison function
may
<em>not</em> work with <TT>qsort</TT>.
The
implications
of any cast you use
when calling qsort
will have been forgotten
by the time <TT>qsort</TT>
gets around to calling your comparison function:
it will call them with <TT>const&nbsp;void&nbsp;*</TT> arguments,
so that is what your function must accept.
No prototype mechanism exists
which could operate down inside <TT>qsort</TT>
to convert the <TT>void</TT> pointers to <TT>struct&nbsp;mystruct</TT> 
pointers just before calling <TT>mywrongstructcmp</TT>.
</p><p>
In general,
it is a bad idea to insert casts just to
``shut the compiler up.''
Compiler warnings are usually trying to tell you something,
and unless you really know what you're doing,
you ignore or
muzzle
them at your peril.
